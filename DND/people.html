<img src="char_Firaliin.png" alt="[portrait] Firaliin Carson" class="portrait">
Played by Mindy Gatlin, Firaliin was born on the 28<sup>th</sup> of Rain's Hand, 4E 276, and was orphaned at an early age.  She was raised by a pack of wolves in the forests near Ivarstead, and has almost no memories of her biological parents.
</p>
<p class="a">
When she was eight, she watched the Temple of Mara in Ivarstead for two days from a nearby tree until she was brave enough to approach Sister Clara as she fed chickens.  The Temple had fifteen clergy, five of whom oversaw the orphanage.  The matron was Mother Beatty, and the four Sisters were Vicki, Clara, Rose, and Elle.  During Firaliin's stay at the orphanage, twenty-three other children stayed there, but only seven stayed long enough for her to remember:  Sara, Kelly, Lora, Polly, Heath, Ricky, and George.
</p>
<p class="a">
After she was driven out of the orphanage, she snuck back in to say goodbye to Sister Clara and was given a battered set of light Imperial armour from the Temple's lost and found, which Firaliin fashioned into a sturdy skirt.
</p>
<p class="a">
She began having dreams about fragments of her past while travelling Skyrim with the Wayfarers, and was reunited with Lora while in Balmoral.  On the 16<sup>th</sup> of Rain's Hand, 4E 303, she was submerged in lifewater, rejuvenating her body to an apparent age of twenty-two.

<img src="char_Thesa.png" alt="[portrait] Thesa Leafwalker" class="portrait">
Played by Tim Cook, Thesa Leafwalker (Mora'lhaj), was born on the 13<sup>th</sup> of Second Seed, 4E 231 under the sign of the Shadow to Russakynd ('Red Child') and Parvolen ('Fist-hammer').  An only child, she enjoyed exploring and finding secret places to hide since her youngest days.
</p>
<p class="a">
At eight she witnessed a lone feral vampire feed on a newlywed couple living in a secluded glen, but wasn't believed by most because the couple, when questioned, denied anything amiss.  Later that year, Thesa was saved by a scout after being ambushed by a ghoul while returning to report finding the couple dead.  The scout summoned a triat of militia who hunted the ghoul, then had Thesa show them the couple's residence.  They had been turned to zombies, however, and the triat destroyed them.  Thesa's hatred of undead was further cemented when she discovered a zombie frostbite spider nest growing on a polluted lifewell; the nest was burned by the militia and the well sealed.
</p>
<p class="a">
She joined the militia in 4E 291 as a scout and began a ten-year period of training.  In 4E 299 she was devastated by her failure both to report a zombie attack on a farmstead quickly enough to save its inhabitants or determine the location of the necromancer that raised them.  Beset by lost confidecnce, her performance faltered, and at the start of 4E 301 she was sent into the greater world to gain experience and prove her worth prior to final induction.  Shortly after her 70<sup>th</sup> birthday, she reached the city of Riften.
</p>
<p class="a">
On the 8<sup>th</sup> of Hearthfire, 4E 301, a djinn exchanged a large amount of Thesa's funds for the ability to unerringly hit any target with her bow.  Akatosh, on the 18<sup>th</sup> of Hearthfire, 4E 301, bestowed draconic abilities of fire breath and resistance upon Thesa, and on the 21<sup>st</sup> of hearthfire, 4E 301, granted her the ability to wield the magical powers of any bow she had held.  Thesa's body was destroyed by Shiera's use of a Reality Stone on the 24<sup>th</sup> of Hearthfire, 4E 301, and her spirit spent the equivalent of a thousand years drifting in the middle region of Aetherius.  She was resurrected by Firaliin a few minutes later and given the mark of a sun on the outer side of her right breast.   On the 14<sup>th</sup> of Rain's Hand, 4E 303, Akatosh embedded a small peridot gem on her sternum that grants the ability to immediately rejoin the party.  On the 16<sup>th</sup> of Rain's Hand, 4E 303, she was submerged in lifewater, rejuvenating her body to an apparent age of fourteen.

<img src="char_Shiera.png" alt="[portrait] Shiera Moonglade" class="portrait">
Played by Sierra Swenka, my name is Shiera, and I was born on the 9<sup>th</sup> of Sun's Dawn, 4E  176 in the city of Elderlan in Atmora.  My family name is Moonglade, and is represented by the colors green and silver.  We follow Frigg&ndash;the goddess of marriage and fertility.  She is known in Tamriel as Mara.  Our symbol is the Tree of Life with a silver crescent moon on either side.
</p>
<p class="a">
My father, King Thaddecus Moonglade, had twin mithril scimitars called 'the Crescents of the Moon', a family heirloom that bonds to its weilder at their coronation and is enchanted to damage opponents with magical radiance and cold (3d6 slashing + 3d6 radiant + 3d6 cold).
</p>
<p class="a">
When I was young, we had some underground caves and tunnels that my siblings and our friends played in.  According to our history lessons, they were made and used by our people to protect themselves from the civil war that was happening in our country.
</p>
<p class="a">
Oriwynn, my family's druid, told me that my ancestors made sure that our allies also had access to these caves and tunnels.  She also told me that her fellow druid put a special spell over them, so that those that would seek to do us harm would not find the entrance.  There was also an awesome old tree I liked to go to when I had a lot on my mind or my siblings were really getting  on my nerves.  I really miss that Old Tree, who helped me with a lot of issues that came up when I was young, and I wish I could talk to her now, so I started to journal about my feelings and thoughts.
</p>
<p class="a">
My family lived in the Eldeen forest of Atmora.  I loved it there for the first thirteen years of my life until I was forced to go on the run with Oriwynn.  Someday, I will go back and see what happened to my family.
</p>
<p class="a">
I had an older brother, Altin (35), and a much younger sister, Fate (9).  I found out that Fate was gravely wounded in the attack, and I'm not sure if she lived or died with the rest of my immediate family.  I am hoping with all my heart that some of my family is still alive.  If they are, then they believe me lost to the sea or amongst the continent of Tamriel.
</p>
<p class="a">
Oriwynn was with me when it all started.  My sister was a few yards away but we couldn't get to her to bring her along with us.  We were able to be smuggled out with the help of the Nightwings, but later we found out that they helped my family to be attacked at the same time they said they were there to help us.  Well, what do you expect from those that serve Loki, after all?  My family had two main allies:  the Liondales, and the Goldenleafs.  Our strongest ally is the Liondales, represented by the colors red and gold, who have their kingdom in the North Pass in Atmora.  They follow Freya, the goddess of love and lust, beauty, and war, who is known as Dibella in Tamriel.  Their symbol is a gold lion between two red hills.
</p>
<p class="a">
When I was born, my father and mother, Thaddecus and Elsa, made a deal with the Liondale King and Queen, Odith and Nalmerry, to betroth me to their youngest son, Tolca.  I am hoping that he still holds some hope that I am alive somewhere.  If Tolca does, then he will have gone to my uncle's brother-in-law to get aid in searching for me, because he is the best tracker that I have ever known and his family, the Goldenleafs, are allies, and I believe that they would search for me in Skyrim because that is near where my last known location.
</p>
<p class="a">
One of my family's main enemies are the Wintermoons, represented by the colors blood red and black.  In public, they follow Skadi&ndash;the goddess of skiing, winter, and bowhunting&ndash;but secretly follow Surtur, giant of fire and the underworld.  Their symbol is a blood-red downward-opening crescent moon above a black, leafless tree.  They have their kingdom in a land called Droam in Atmora.  They were originally amicable with my family, but then they became enraged when their offer of marriage between their second-oldest son, Tari, and myself was turned down in favor of the Liondales.  They took their time in organizing an army of orcs and goblins, which burned my family's kingdom and slaughtered nearly all my family and my people.
</p>
<p class="a">
The Nightwing family, represented by the colors dark grey and azure, are a scheming, shrewd lot.  They follow Loki&ndash;the god of mischief, known as Lorkhan in Tamriel&ndash;and harbour no loyalty to anyone.  Their symbol is a triangle of azure stars between a pair of upraised grey wings. They live in the Talenta Plains of Atmora.  They look for any way to work all sides of a conflict and theu will only help if they see an advantage that will help them.
</p>
<p class="a">
We found out that they helped to provide support to the attack on my kingdom at the same time they helped us by directing Oriwynn and myself to the safest escape route.
</p>
<p class="a">
The Silverhand clan is a bitter enemy of the Liondales, and&ndash;by association&ndash;the Moonglades.  They are represented by the colors silver and black. They follow Mimir, the god of knowledge and wisdom.  Their symbol is an open eye on the palm of a silver, upraised right hand.  They are strong magic-users, and their aggression towards the Liondales prevented aid from to coming to my kingdom when we were attacked by the orcs and goblins.
</p>
<p class="a">
The Silverhand's land is called Duchy of Valenar, and the main reason that they hate the Liondales is because every time they have to go Tronjheim to get special supplies, or the people Tronjheim want to go by land to other places inland, they have to pass through Liondale land to get to their destination because they can't always go by boat.
</p>
<p class="a">
Oriwynn didn't trust the Nightwings, so once we landed in Tamriel we moved into Skyrim so they wouldn't know where we were or in what country.  The first two years we went from country to country until we settled in Sungard for a few years.  We kept moving every so often, so that no one could find us very easily.
</p>
<p class="a">
We initially landed in High Rock town called North Point, but the first town we settled for any length of time was Sungard in Skyrim.
</p>
<p class="a">
During our journeys, we visited the following places in High Rock:  Normar Heights, While Haven, the Crypt of Hearts, Llessan Hills, Wind Keep, Cloud Spring, and Moonguard.  In Hammerfell, we passed through Heldom Mount, Skaven, Thorstad, Chesetown, Kamyer Falls, Stonemoor, and Nimbel.  In Cyrodiil, there were Applewatch, Bruma, Weve, Hackdirt, Faregyl, Alabaster, Blankenmarch, Darklowe, and Harlun'ss Watch.  In the places where the Aldmeri Dominion was involved in their war, the people sometimes made things difficult for us, but as we went further south, it was the dreadful heat that was our worst enemy!
</p>
<p class="a">
Because we're elves, we were allowed to visit their homelands; in Valenwood, we went to Thormar Keep, Stone Fall, Meadow Run, Vullen Haven, and Eagle Vale Haven, and on the Summerset Isles, we visited King's Watch, Graddun Spring, Marbrok Brook, Holly Falls, Silver Wood, Old Falls, and West Guard.
</p>
<p class="a">
We travelled east through the scorching desterts of Elsweyer and saw Seaplace, Tardon Wood, Riverhold, King's Walk, the Hall of the Colossus, Valley Guard, Greenvale, Helmthor Mount, Duncon Walk, Chasegrove, and South Guard.
</p>
<p class="a">
The Argonian homeland of Black Marsh was a reeking, foetid fen and I could barely stand the choking heat and humidity.  We passed through Tenmar Wall, Gianbridge, Chasepoint, Rockspring, Rockpark, Murkwood, Riverbridge, Rockpoint, and Riverwalk.  From there we went north into Morrowind, and visited Dagon Fel, Carnaris View, Balfalls, Bodrum, Kragenmoor, Heimlyn Keep, Old Kepp, Kithendis Falls, Dervon's Watch, and Greenheights.
</p>
<p class="a">
We briefly passed through Skaal in Solstheim, then continued into Skyrim and came to Helarchen Creek, Stonehills, Dragonbridge, Snowhawk, North Hall, Oakwood, Sungard, Laintar Dale, and spent a few nights with an encampment of scholars from the Mages College at the Ruins of Labyrinthian.
</p>
<p class="a">
While we were on the roads and traveling, Oriwynn taught me a lot about the druids and their culture as well as my own culture.  She was not only my savior but she became a mother to me, and she never let me forget my family and hope to one day go back to home land.  She showed me how to let go of most of my anger and understand the real enemy and what is needed to be done.  Oriwynn was very talented, and she taught how to survive in the woods and almost any other terrain.  She taught me that to survive I have to have my own set of rules and an understanding about other cultures.  She said it would be a very good thing that I know and understand other Gods and Goddesses and other creatures of the forest, so that I would respect them and understand where everyone is coming from with their opinions.
</p>
<p class="a">
We did this together until, one day, Oriwynn was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She left me at a market stall to wait for an order to be finished while she went to go pick up something else that we'd ordered, and was close to being done.
</p>
<p class="a">
I heard screams, and people were running away from the direction in which Oriwynn had gone, so I ran toward the screams and came upon Oriwynn lying in the street. The guards were there holding two men apart on the opposite sides of her body.  I asked what happened, and they said that she was trying to stop a fight between the men but they were too far into the fight to really see or hear her.  Because of that, she was stabbed in the gut and bled out.  I asked what they were fighting over, and after they told their stories, I just kind of yelled at the top of my lungs, and shouted, "My mom was killed because the same woman was spending time with both of you, and you couldn't handle the competition?  Wow, you are not true men at all."
</p>
<p class="a">
I buried her in true druid fashion in the woods, in the middle of a stand of really old trees that she will help nourish and rejoin the circle of life&ndash;the way she would have wanted.  I was 95 years old, and I have been on my own since then and am still moving from place to place, just as she taught me.  I miss her every day, but I am practicing what she taught me and following my own rules as long as I am doing the right thing.
</p>
<p class="a">
It's been thirty years since Oriwynn died, and I am tired of being alone and not having any connection to my family and my past.  Riften is just down the road&hellip;

Driven by a strong urge to help innocents and children as a cleric, she saved the life of Fauna, the firstborn daughter of High King Istlod of Skyrim in 4E&nbsp;184 and was made a Thane of Haafingar.  Five years later, she commanded Solitude's forces as a general, directing their efforts to conquer Skyrim and annex Atmora.   In 4E&nbsp;230, she battles Tazam&eacute;, now a lich, at Whiterun, and in 4E&nbsp;241 slays the Dovahkiin who defeated Alduin.  eventually discovering the skyship Starstreak in Dawnstar on the 14<sup>th</sup> of Hearthfire, 4E&nbsp;301, bonding with the vessel and joining the Wayfarers.  On the 16<sup>th</sup> of Rain's Hand, 4E&nbsp;303, she was submerged in lifewater, rejuvenating her body to an apparent age of twenty-four.

The daughter of Jarl Vidik Free-Winter, Jenna has a strong sense of duty and empathy for others.  She is greatly loved by the people of Eastmarch, with a repuation as a free-spirited individual who flouts convention.  Having secretly received training from the Captain of the Guard of Windhelm from an early age, she is skilled in combat and disguised herself to fight in Windhelm's arena at the age of fifteen, attaining a high rank.  When she was seven, her father and the High King of Skyrim arranged a marriage between her and Prince Theobold Civette for her eighteenth birthday to solidify relations between the two holds.  During one of Theobold's visits to Windhelm, his servant Sarah Lind fell in love with Jenna, and later recognised her at the arena and leveraged the knowledge to initiate an intimate relationship with Jenna.
</p>
<p class="a">
After Sarah attempted to assassinate Theobold and slew a stand-in, Jenna claimed guilt both for that and the murder the previous night of Arthur Moonglade, and was reluctantly arrested and escorted to Castle Dour in Solitude during the height of the Riglametha festival.  The Wayfarers established her innocence and heroism during the initial Daedric invasion, and agreed to escort her back to Windhelm.  While she and the Wayfarers were trapped in Balmoral, Jenna's servant Anna returned to Windhelm and supposed Jenna dead, leading to severe deterioration in relations between Haafingar and Eastmarch.  When Jenna returned to Windhelm in 4E&nbsp;303, her ability at combat was revealed and tested, followed by a grand celebration.

Hyri&eacute; is a Daedric succubus who was used as a communication conduit between Lorac Brenner and the Daedric Princes Boethiah, Mhehrunes Dagon, and Molag Bal.  Contained in a summoning circle in a hidden back room of the Temple of Divines in Solitude, she was physically tortured by Lorac for his amusement and mechanism to release his hatred of the Daedra.  On the 18<sup>th</sup> of Hearthfire, 4E&nbsp;301, Akara disrupted the circle containing her and Stolovold slew her, animating her as a zombie under his control to confront the bishop.  She was able to exert her own will enough to attempt to tear out Brenner's heart, only to discover it missing.  She then briefly became a mouthpiece for the threee Daedric Princes, and her essence was returned to the Oblivion plane of Coldharbour when Akatosh banished the invading Daedra and their followers.
