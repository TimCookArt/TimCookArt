	</tr>
	<tr class="a"><!-- Altmer -->
		<td class="name">Altmer</td>
		<td>'Cultured Folk' or 'High Elves', a golden-skinned race hailing from the Summerset Isles.  Though they are resented by the other races and seen as snobbish, the common tongue of Tamriel is based on their speech and writing, and they are exceptionally skilled in magic use.  They see the physical realm of Mundus as a betrayal usurping their proper existence in aetherius.  Their pantheon consists of Anui-El, Auri-El, Jephre, Lorkhan, Magnus, Mara, Phynaster, Stendarr, Syrabane, Trinimac, Xarxes, and Xen.</td>

		<td>'Tree-sap Folk', known as 'Wood Elves', are olive-skinned elves from Valenwood who reject the stiff formalities of Aldmeri culture and live in harmony with the land and its creatures.  They are skilled archers, and have the ability to command some beasts and blend, chameleon-like, in forested areas.  Some follow the tenets of the Green Pact, which forbids harming the forests of Valenwood, eating anything made from plant life, killing wastefully, or taking on the shape of beasts.  Further, the Pact requires its adherants to eat only meat, and to eat the remains of defeated enemies rather than leaving them to rot.  Their pantheon is Arkay, Auri-El, Baan Dar, Herma-Mora, Ius, Jode, Jone, Lorkhan, Mara, Stendarr, Xarxes, Y'ffre, and Z'en.</td>

		<td class="name">Dunmer</td>
		<td>'Dark Folk' have ash-grey skin and typically red eyes.  Their appearance is a curse from Azura after the events of the Battle of Red Mountain around 1E 700.  Morrowind is their homeland, but its devastation in 4E 5 due to the violent eruption of the Red Mountain drove many to seek refuge elsewhere in Tamriel.  They follow Azura, Boethiah, Lorkhan, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Mephala, and Sheogorath.</td>

		<td class="name">Dwemer</td>
		<td>'Deep Folk', referred to as dwarves (a name given by the giants&ndash;they were in fact the same size as other elves), a group of elves primarily from Morrowind that lived in complex underground cities.  Their endeavours focused on science, engineering, and the arcane.  They disappeared en masse around 1E 700 after attempting to manipulate the Heart of Lorkhan at the end of the Battle of Red Mountain.  Their sprawling subterranean ruins are identifiable by blocky stone structures with gleaming metal roofs.  <small>(This race is presumed extinct.)</small></td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="a"><!-- Falmer -->
		<td class="name">Falmer</td>
		<td>'Snow Folk', the original elven inhabitants of Skyrim, forced to eat toxic fungi and mutated into sightless slaves by the Dwemer after seeking refuge from encroaching Nords.  Their pantheon consisted of Auri-El, Jephre, Phynaster, Syabane, and Trinimac.  After the Dwemer vanished, they reverted to a feral group that harbours great hatred for the surface world and its inhabitants.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="a"><!-- Maormer -->
		<td class="name">Maormer</td>
		<td>'Sea Folk', a mysterious race that lives on the tropical continent of Pyandonea, far to the south of Tamriel.  They have blank white eyes and pallid skin with a chameleon-like property similar to the Bosmers'.  They practise a powerful form of snake magic and weather control.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="a"><!-- Orsimer -->
		<td class="name">Orsimer</td>
		<td>'Pariah Folk', commonly known as 'Orcs', hail from Orsinium in the Wrothgar Mountains of High Rock and are renowned as much for their craftmanship of armour and weapons as for their berserker rage.  They were supposedly created when the Daedric Prince Boethiah devoured the Aldmeri god Trinimac and expelled him as Malacath, transforming Trinimac's worshippers into orcs.</td>
