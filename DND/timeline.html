<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Cosmology of Aurbis</button>
<div class="content">
	<p class="a">Before the realm of Mundus existed, the overlap between the primal forces Anu (stasis, known as Ahnurr to the Khajiit) and Padomay (change, known as Fadomai) formed the Aurbis, or existence.  Interplay between Anu and Padomay and the Aurbis respectively generated Anui-El (known as Satak to the Redguard)&ndash;the soul of all living things and everlasting light&ndash;and Sithis (known as Akal to the Redguard)&ndash;emptiness and void.  From Anui-El came Auri-El&ndash;the First Deity, who is the Dragon God of Time (known as Akatosh to most of the human races, Alkosh to the Khajiit, and Ruptga to the Redguards), and from Sithis came Lorkhan.  Numerous et'ada (or spirits) sprang into being independently out of the Aurbis.</p>
	<p class="a">Lorkhan persuaded some of the et'ada to give part of themselves to create the material plane of Mundus, with the one called Magnus being its architect.  These became known as Aedra and formed eight planets and the world Nirn with its physical laws.  Daedra, et'ada who did not help creating Mundus, exist in realms collectively known as Oblivion that separate Mundus from Aetherius, the Immortal Plane where the et'ada originated, to where the souls of the dead are purported to go, and the origin of all magic.</p>
	<p class="a">Because they had been tricked into giving up much of their power, the Aedra met and decided to punish Lorkhan.  The et'ada Trinimac, a great warrior, tore Lorkhan's heart out and gave it to Auri-El, who fired it into the sea with a bow.  Its impact created the volcano known as Red Mountain on Vvardenfell (which imbued Nirn with Lorkhan's spirit and selfishness), while Lorkhan's body remained floating in the sky as the moons Masser and Secunda (Jone and Jode to the Bosmer).</p>
	<p class="a">Magnus, disgusted by Mundus' corrupted nature, left for Aetherius and ripped a hole in Oblivion, which is seen as the sun.  Other et'ada known as Magna Ge followed Magnus, leaving smaller holes which are the stars.</p>

At the break of dawn, Shiera meets with the Dark Brotherhood contact near the Kjenstag Ruins and declines their terms in exchange for Cicero's journal.  Later in the morning, Shiera meets with the Bishop in Solitude, presenting the daedric dagger for destruction and her father's ashes for blessing.  Firaliin is assigned as the party's healer for the festival by the High King.  At midday, Lady Jenna Free-Winter is arrested and escorted to Castle Dour.  In the late afternoon, a noble without shoes mysteriously freezes in the streets of Solitude.

<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 18</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, Shiera petitions the High King to establish new buildings for sanitarium and orphanage.  The Temple and bishop are investigated by the party, Akara consults the High King regarding the situation, and the bishop's connection to the Dark Brotherhood and Daedric Princes Boethiah, Molag Bal, and Mehrunes Dagon are discovered around midday.  After Akara breaks the summoning circle containing the succubus being used as an intermediary between the Daedra and Lorac, Stolovold kills her and turns her into a zombie, sending her to confront the bishop.  The succubus attempts to rip out Lorac's heart, discovers it missing, and becomes a mouthpiece for the Daedric Princes who have decided he is no longer needed for their plans.  Oblivion portals open around the city, and Akara petitions Akatosh for aid.  A temporal abberation engulfs the area, allowing the party to defeat an initial goup of the Daedra.  Akatosh pulls the group outside of time to bestow draconic gifts upon each.  Akara destroys the city docks.  Solitude's reawakened gargoyle joins the party and is given the name Angelina.  The invading Daedra, the city's citizens that followed the Princes, and the cathedral itself are erased from existence.  After the incident, the High King charges the party with finding and destroying Lorac's phylactory and assessing the safety of the other holds' capitals due to concern that the Princes wouldn't likely work together to strike just one city.</p>

<p class="a">In the morning, Shiera visits and questions Jenna Free-Winter, learning that she is taking on the burden of guilt to allow both Shiera freedom to deal with the fallout of her uncle and the bishop's dealings with the Daedra and to protect others from what chaos might result from her identifying her fiance&eacute;'s killer, and that she provided significant assistance in defeating an invading Daedra the previous night.  Firaliin and Shiera commission dresses for the upcoming Equinox Ball.  Stolovold investigates local job offers and kills a Daedra near Dragon Bridge after it dispatches three bandits.  Firaliin, Shiera, and Thesa eradicate an illegal logging group and a trio of demented orcs, then are joined by Stolovold in the afternoon to locate and a destroy a nest of vampires.  Firaliin asks a Dunmer caf&eacute; proprieter to be her date for the ball.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 20</p>
<p class="a">Solitude is rebuilt in record time with the full resources of the East Empire Company in play.  The Starstreak is moored at the new skydock at the Wayfarers' estate.  Olga and Ernest are hired as ship staff.  Olga demonstrates her skill at beverage-making.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 21</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, the party gets their attire for the ball.  In the evening at sundown, they go to the Blue Palace.  Akara entertains the attending younger children, one of whom grows especially attached to her.  Angelina is surrounded by admiring cityfolk familiar with her historical role.  Shiera finds a lost, amnesiac young lady with glowing skin.  The High King announces a scavenger hunt as the night's entertainment, locking down the palace.  The first two clues found are "Who serves, sleeps" and "Who is most loyal?".  Stolovold learns of a skinwalker sorcerer.  After investigating the servants' quarters and finding the clue "Who still sleeps", some of the party decide to search the royal family crypts.  A mysterious faun girl is encountered there, drawing an unusual reaction from Thesa.  Theobold's empty bier is found to hold a scavenger hunt clue&ndash;"Who yet walks"&ndash;as well as being the trigger to open a magically-hidden door.  Firaalin's date is instructed to stay in place to allow the rest of the group entrance, but she is possessed by a treasonous curse.  The party traverses a passage leading to the meeting place of cultlike conspirators.  A sewer dragon and three cult members are dispatched by the party, and evidence of the conspiracy's machinations is found:  a roster of names, manifesto, and various other documents.  Thesa finds a dark gem, which binds itself to her flesh, and is later blessed by Auri-El.  The party brings the information to the High King, and the Daedra responsible for the magic wards in the crypt appears from the gem after it transfers to Firaliin's date and explodes from the energy of the curse, freeing her of its effects.  The party, High King, court mage, and djinn defeat the Daedra, after which Shiera harvests the corpse.  Theobold reveals himself to be alive and presents the key to the palace and the brooch known as the Soul of Solitude to Shiera, and explains the situation regarding the conspiracy and concern about Jenna's loyalty.  Shiera pleads for Jenna's case, and the Lady is brought from the prison and released.  The High King requests the party's consul to determine the fate of Sarah, and the girl is sentenced to work at the new orphanage, never to see Jenna again or leave the cathedral grounds.  Jenna is temporarily exiled from Solitude, the party charged with escorting her back to Windhelm after assessing the safety of the hold capitals.  Akara obliterates an old adversary with her newfound power.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 22</p>
<p class="a">Shiera and Stolovold separately go shopping, then some of the party gathers in the bar.  Jenna is given gifts and offered alcohol by a halway-drunk Shiera.  Firaliin receives a thank-you note from her date.  Thesa and Firaliin spend the day meditating.  Shiera acquires sewer-dragon armour for Jenna from the tailor Smee-Twists-Flax.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 23</p>
<p class="a">Shiera invisibly wreaks mischief at local bars with Firaliin.  Stolovold assembles a cache of platinum ingots.  Shiera plants fruits and vegetables in the arboretum and gets spidersilk-and-leather clothing from Smee-Twists-Flax.  The group plans a travel itinerary to go to the hermit near Evermore in High Rock who has information about the flowers needed to permanently awaken Angelina via Markarth in the Reach.  The ship unmoors and disembarks.  Stolovold teleports to Riften and reconnoiters the Thieves' Guild, killing the seven thieves there before returning to the ship.  Shiera and Firaliin confront Solovold about information from the bishop's books.  Stolovold teleports away to read the books and learns of the bishop's history and phylactory's location in Ivarstead, and Shiera and Firaliin scour the room and rearrange the furniture.  Shiera investigates the suit of Dwemer armour.  After much convincing, Jenna's servant Anna allows the Lady to combat train with Shiera.  Thesa puts a pitcher of laxative-laced water on Stolovold's desk.  Jenna handily holds her own versus Shiera after Anna is told to return to her room, revealing her skills.  Shiera gives Jenna a brief tour of the ship.  Stolovold drinks the laxative-laced water, then teleports to Riften to loot the thieves after he is finished relieving himself, after which he returns to the ship and rearranges his room.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 24</p>
<p class="a">At dawn, the party encounters a Daedric scout near Karthwasten and chases it, Firaliin destroying them at Four Skull Lookout.</p>
<p class="a">To the south, the party spies a massive gathering of a legion of Daedra around a reddish-purple pillar of light at Sky Haven Temple.  Stolovold begins to investigate, and casts meteor swarm at the Daedra camp while Sierra orders the ship closer to attack.  The Daedra's forcefield deflects the brunt of the meteor swarm, but the ship's main weapon, a plasma lance, overcomes the barrier and creates a giant crater.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera uses her reality stone to kill all Daedra in a fifty-mile radius by removing their flesh and leaving their skeletons, inadvertently killing Thesa and Akara.</p>
<p class="a">During their incapacitation, Thesa's soul spends one thousand years in aetherius and Akara three thousand.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin resurrects Thesa and Akara; each revives bearing a sun symbol tattoo.  The psychic backlash of the massive amount of death overwhelms the glowing amnesiac girl who sheds tears of blood while clutching her hands to her chest and sobbing.  While Jenna and Firaliin calm her, Shiera stores Akara's skeleton in her vault chamber.</p>
<p class="a">The party gathers the bones of the Daedra and stores them in the ship's vault.</p>
<p class="a">Akara enters the pillar of light, casts astral trench on the daedric military base found there, and returns to Sky Haven Temple.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera investigates inside the temple, finds controls for the portal and has Akara reconfigure them, while Stolovold casts a protective barrier around the temple to stop further use by Daedra.</p>
<p class="a">The ship continues to Markarth and arrives midafternoon.  While Akara stays on the ship, the rest of the party is directed to the jarl and informs her of Shiera's divination.  The Jarl requests the party investigate and eliminate the invading Daedra after Shiera divines four portal locations, and a squad of guards are assigned to assist.</p>
<p class="a">The group spends the rest of the day into the evening completing the task, encountering and freezing a Daedra at the first portal, a shrine to Molag Bal at the second, a Daedra-worshipper at the third, sixteen infiltrator Daedra on the streets while investigating, and activating Nchuand-Zel's defenses which engage a group of Daedra at the fourth portal after the party slays a giant frostbite spider and several Falmer.  The group is invited to a feast the following evening.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 25</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, Shiera has a nightmare that she remembered from her childhood involving the negotiations for her betrothal.  She relates the dream and its inclusion of a supposed older sister which she doesn't have, and confesses to killing her uncle to Firaliin in lion cub form, who comforts her.  Shiera has another dream involving her supposed older sister, and awakens to cast divination to ascertain its meaning.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold continues gathering personal wealth and gets his shirt enchanted.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera asks Knaz about the mountains she saw in her divination, and then asks the court cartographer about the city.  He relates the tale of the utopia-like fairytale city of Balmoral hidden in the Druadach mountains.</p>
<p class="a">During the day, the group plays hide-and-seek aboard the ship.</p>
<p class="a">In the evening, on the way to the feast, Shiera kills a goblin who is attempting to kidnap a child.</p>
<p class="a">The group is detained and Akara is put on trial by the jarls and ambassadors from other nations in Tamriel and banished from settlements until she has regained trust by performing a series of tasks for each.</p>
<p class="a">Angelina returns to Solitude to mull over what she has learned of Akara's crimes.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 26</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin decides to examine her property in the Reach.</p>
<p class="a">En route to Firaliin's property, Akara is attacked by goblins and Tinkerbell is overcome by an odd sickness.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin sells her property in the Reach to the innkeeper of Old Hroldan and the owner of Soljund's Sinkhole.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold discovers the theft of the ship's gold.</p>
<p class="a">On returning to Markarth, Shiera seeks an alchemist to transmorgrify her tattoo wings into physical angellic/dragon wings and acquires feathers from Akara, making quite an impression on the alchemist (who becomes a worshipper of Akara).</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold is confronted by denizens of the Shadowfell who take back their resources.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera gets treatment for Tinkerbell's odd sickness.</p>
<p class="a">The group decides to seek Balmoral and sets out in the late afternoon.</p>
<p class="a">The party flies up to the forested mountaintops and locates a village.  Akara flings Stolovold and Thesa towards it, entangling Thesa in the clutches of a dryad, and after Firaliin and Akara see the faun girl briefly in the forest and Shiera rescues Thesa, the group meets at the village Stonehelm in a hollow in the mountain.</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald of the Flame, a paladin, is ordered by the local cleric to aid the party in eradicating the necromancer causing a wasting-and-resurrection curse on the village.</p>
<p class="a">The party learns from the village elder that Olga and Ernest's came from Stonehelm.</p>
<p class="a">Akara and the blacksmith form a bond upon meeting.</p>
<p class="a">Late at night, some of the party meets Greta, Olga's mother, at the tavern.  Thesa returns to the ship to rest and assures Olga the party will do their best to dispell the curse, and Shiera leaves a gift for Sir Reginald.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 27</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, much amusement is had at Sir Reginald's expense, and the party enters the necromancer's manor after eliminating the guardians of its entrance.  They encounter some of its unusual inhabitants, and return a dead girl's toy bear.  The party acquires a strange orb and an enchanted sword, and battles a minion of the necromancer and a number of skeletons before locating a safe-room established by a former group of Sir Reginald's order.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 28</p>
<p class="a">A barbarian named Leroy Jenkins is found sleeping under a pile of corpses in the safe-room.  Sir Reginald's faith is shaken by discovering that his leader was a thrall to the necromancer, and the party dispatches the corrupt cleric, the graveyard keeper, and the necromancer (25750 XP).  The curse on the village is lifted, and Olga has a joyful reunion with her parents.</p>
<p class="a">The Nord barbarian Olik, a blacksmith, becomes fond of Akara.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera asks the villagers about Balmoral.</p>
<p class="a">The Miracle Man releases Sir Reginald from his duties in order to 'find himself'.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 29</p>
<p class="a">Upon waking in the morning, Shiera practices flying and whittling, then finds a cave with a strange purple glow while gathering twigs and fallen logs in the forest.</p>
<p class="a">Thesa joins her after perusing the ship's maps and they find a Daedric portal rune and two sets of footprints; one leads back to town, which the party investigates after the rune is dispelled.</p>
<p class="a">A disguised Daedra is found and defeated (300 XP) in the mayor's manor, then in another room a Smothering Rug (450 XP) is destroyed after Shiera is trapped by it and released by Tinkerbell.</p>
<p class="a">They return to the cave after establishing the manor's bathroom's safety.</p>
<p class="a">They follow the other pair of footprints and slay a masked individual, promptly forgetting the event when they look away due to the enchantment on the mask.</p>
<p class="a">The cottage has many pelts and bear-related items, leading to the impression that the person was a druid.</p>
<p class="a">Thesa adds to her collection of masks throughout the day, and consumes some of the flesh of the man before burying him, and the group returns to the ship.</p>
<p class="a">In the midafternoon, Shiera encounters some zombies and sees a strange purple effect disturbing the mountain.</p>
<p class="a">The skeleton of the necromancer appears and accosts Sir Reginald, and Thesa returns to the ship and begins charging its main weapon to assault the enemy.  Shiera watches from the base of a nearby tree.</p>
<p class="a">The radiant blast destroys the undead (6100 XP) and creates a large crater 1/2 mile by 10 miles where the graveyard was, which punctures an underground spring and fills the basin with holy water.</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald begins exhibiting unusual behaviour.</p>
<p class="date">301 Hearthfire 30</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, the group encounters a sky-whale three times the size of the ship.  Akara approaches, disturbing it.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin communicates with the sky-whale and it leads the ship to its family, its sibling knocking the ship out of the sky.</p>
<p class="a">The ship is severely damaged, and Akara seeks vengeance from the whales, learning something disturbing from one of their matrons.</p>
<p class="a">The deer girl shows up again, and Firaliin freezes time and captures her after Thesa, Shiera, and Tinkerbell give chase.</p>
<p class="a">The ship's crew and passengers are shocked to learn of Stolovold's profession when he raises a group of skeletons to help repair the ship.</p>
<p class="a">The deer-girl, Alis Windsong, is interrogated and she agrees to temporarily join the party to find Balmoral.</p>
<p class="date">301 Frostfall 01</p>
<p class="a">Alis plays a lullaby for Firaliin in the middle of the night, causing her to remember her mother singing it when she was very young.</p>
<p class="a">Olga informs group that polka band has left in fear of Stolovold, and Anna expresses displeasure as well.</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald secludes himself in his bunk to meditate, and Akara is overcome by illness.</p>
<p class="a">The group discusses Firaliin and Shiera's dreams and Alis plays the lullaby as part of a medly of folk songs from Falkreath and the Rift.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera repairs the railings and refinishes the main deck.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold researches a spell.</p>
<p class="a">Thesa spies on Firaliin and Alis as they gather flowers and become close.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera hunts for a suitable tree to replace the the main mast and sees a plume of smoke rising from the forest.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin dumps flower petals on Anna after she and Jenna join the gathering, to Anna's unamusement and the mirth of the others.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold investigates the plume of smoke Shiera saw in the woods, finding two travellers and the polka band.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin, Shiera, and Jenna decide to have Anna serve under Olga as an assistant.</p>
<p class="a">The main mast is replaced after Stolovold fabricates the pine tree into a bare pole.</p>
<p class="a">The group finds Anna in the back area of the bar cleaning the oven while wearing a frilly barmaid outfit that reveals much, and Alis playfully swats her backside as they call Jenna in to see the situation, causing a great deal of embarassment to the Lady and her servant.</p>
<p class="a">After dinner, Alis goes to join Firaliin in her tree for the evening and they are briefly joined by Shiera.  Stolovold, having glimpsed Alis' thoughts and intentions, casts a curse on the deer-girl to mitigate the effects of her libido for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="date">301 Frostfall 02</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, Stolovold repairs the sails.</p>
<p class="a">Akara harvests tissue samples from everyone on board in a gruesome manner after the group gathers in the mess, resulting in Thesa tasting some of Alis' flesh.</p>
<p class="a">Knaz informs the crew that it will take two to three weeks to repair the ship.</p>
<p class="a">The party and Jenna set off.  Shiera and Akara scout ahead and see the travellers from the previous day and Akara confronts them, and they identify as pilgrims named Oman Tapu and Reyna Leodi from an enclave between High Rock and Hammerfell going to Balmoral.</p>
<p class="a">Santa appears and gives the group gifts:  Akara gets an intermittently-flickering amulet with an eye and a key, Alis gets a red velvet choker, Firaliin gets a music box that plays her mother's lullaby, Jenna gets an hourglass, Shiera gets a family heirloom she lost as a child, Stolovold gets a talking skull, Thesa gets a scenery orb, Oman gets a ring of strength, and Reyna gets a ring of courage.</p>
<p class="a">The party gets to the cave entance at dusk and sets up camp, at which point Angelina appears, teleporting from Solitude.</p>
<p class="date">301 Frostfall 03</p>
<p class="a">As the party begins to investigate the cave, Reyna discusses her pet fenchilla, George III, with Firaliin, attracting Alis' interest.</p>
<p class="a">Tinkerbell tries to pick Sir Reginald's pocket but drops his mother's amulet down a crack.  Stolovold, hearing something fall, investigates and finds three gold coins.</p>
<p class="a">Thesa is deafened by a bat while trying to listen, and Firaliin cuts it out of the air with a thrown dagger.</p>
<p class="a">Reyna relates a signpost to finding Balmoral being 'a glowing pyramid of stone beside dark glass'.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera has the group put out their torches, and sees the tips of the stalagmites and stalagtites, tiny flecks in the wall, and Stolovold's mindstone ring glowing.</p>
<p class="a">Tinkerbell spots bones in the next large chamber, so the party chooses the other path exiting their current location.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera relights the torches, and it is discovered that Sir Reginald is missing, so Akara is sent to find him.</p>
<p class="a">The party encounters a narrow tunnel with a dropoff, which Firaliin scouts in owl form and discovers a 75-foot spider and its web.</p>
<p class="a">The party tries a different route, and Firaliin immediately encounters a giant bat, which she grabs mid-flight with her talons and rips its head off.  The party defeats 29 more bats in a swarm (1500 XP).</p>
<p class="a">The party backtracks and crosses a dark underground lake beside which stands a glowing stone pyramid.</p>
<p class="a">Akara and Sir Reginald rejoin the party from a side-tunnel, and the group arrives at the gleaming, pearlescent-spired city of Balmoral deep in a mountain crater whose walls are laced with glowing crystal.</p>
<p class="a">Alis and Firaliin enjoy the green grass and refreshing air together before entering the city proper.</p>
<p class="a">Akara admires crystal stained-glass windows, Stolovold encounters difficulties with his mind stone, and Firaliin meets someone she remembers from her childhood.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold finds something unusual about the town records and shows the party.</p>
<p class="a">Akara hurls the book in Shiera's direction, who had been looking for clues about her dream-sister by herself.</p>
<p class="a">The unusual lack of apparent passage of time and the city's populace's vague memories is discovered.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera finds a ruined house with a skeleton wearing the same dress as her dream-sister, and a Moonglade family crest amulet reading 'To Angelica, with Luck from Penelope' on the back, and a journal whose last entry is dated 2E715 Second Seed 06.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera calls the party to her, and they decide to eat and rest after Shiera relates information about her great-great-grandmother's sister, her theory about the temporal issues, and her ancestor's ability to contact her in dreams.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera has a disturbing vision while she meditates, first seeing a gloomy crater with lattices of blue crystals in its walls, jagged teeth-like spires, and decaying comatose and dead bodies, then an angry purple sky raining over a burned-out estate with the body of a girl wearing a tan-and-yellow lolita-style dress.</p>
<p class="a">After waking, Shiera helps clean an old woman's attic and finds a 4200-year old Cyrodiilic necklace the woman says was her grandmother's wedding present, a blue crystal shard with a note that reads 'Might be more in Druadach Mts, will pay 5000 for more (mind power?)', and a slightly-creepy doll.</p>
<p class="a">The party then goes to the town hall, where Shiera finds her great-great-grandmother's sister's name in Volume 543 of the town records.</p>
<p class="a">Jenna tries to convince the group to stay in the city, and Shiera realises a connection between her vision and Balmoral, trying to convince the group to leave, though Firaliin wants to stay and turns into a gnat to avoid Tinkerbell's attempt to subdue her.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera finds Lora in the market and incapacitates her, returning to the place where the party entered the crater.</p>
<p class="a">Finding nothing but a hairline crack, Shiera casts dispell magic to minimal effect, then smashes one of the blue crystals in the rock face, briefly revealing Balmoral's true state.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold investigates this phenomenon and touches his mind stone to a crystal, being overwhelmed by a sense of a consciousness housed in the complex lattice.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera flies up to the edge of the crater, away from the influence of Balmoral, and is able to make contact with Knaz, who informs her that one and a half years have passed since the party entered Balmoral and directs the repaired ship to the Wayfarers' location.</p>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 13</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald begins smashing more crystals, breaking Balmoral's hold on the group long enough for Firaliin to turn into a roc and carry them to a safer distance while the Starstreak arrives and fires on the crystals in the walls, disrupting their influence.</p>
<p class="a">Knaz notes the ship is low on power, so Shiera suggests harvesting nodes of the crystal to serve as temporary replacements.</p>
<p class="a">Balmoral's occupants are taken aboard the ship and healed, Shiera and Stolovold cooperating to furnish bedding.</p>
<p class="a">The ship flees Balmoral, heading for Evermore in High Rock&ndash;150 miles to the south-southwest&ndash;arriving at dusk, finding the city burning and being circled in the air by Daedra while many of its residents flee, matching one of Shiera's earlier visions.  Shiera wants to attack directly, but Thesa cautions against potentially futile engagements without having better knowledge of the scope of the invasion.  The ship lands while the party considers their course of action.</p>
<p class="a">Akara takes Sir Reginald to Blackreach to meet with a human White Mage researching restoring Falmer, and glimpses a construction site in the distance which on brief scouting turns out to be Imperial Soldiers constructing military airships.  Apart from seven 'intelligent' restored Falmer, the rest Akara sees in Blackreach have been crucified and had a 'T' carved into their chests.  She finds Fauna, also crucified, with the words 'Love you, sis' carved in her chest.  She and Sir Reginald build a pyre and immolate the dead bodies.</p>
<p class="a">Some of the Balmorans start complaining and expressing a desire to return, and some of the younger children run amok in the arboretum and bridge.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera leaves the ship and begins directing refugees aboard.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin and Thesa find the hermit alchemist's shack hidden in a cave in the forested foothills.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera interrogates a refugee, rebutting the negative rumours they'd heard.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera suggests the idea to Knaz of developing a cloaking device for the ship.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera gathers 203 refugees over the course of the night.</p>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 14</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin and Thesa gather flowerfrogs, bringing them to the alchemist (who is revealed to be a drider, much to Firaliin's discomfort) who buys two for 13,000 gold and makes the potion for 500 gold.</p>
<p class="a">The potion is administered to Angelina as a flying Daedra approaches the area, and she metamorphoses into a glowing angel and knocks out the scout, throwing it to the ship's deck.  The unconscious Daedra is placed in the ship's brig.</p>
<p class="a">The ship sets course for Ivarstead.</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, Shiera teleports the majority of the refugees and Ernest to Solitude and meets with the High King.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera meets with Tolca, and the High King provides them a private conference room, which they use to consumate their relationship, Shiera taking the lead with primal enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera, Tolca, Theobold, and Ernest teleport back to the ship, which diverts its course for the Karlsen estate in Falkreath, which it reaches at dusk.</p>
<p class="a">Jenna and Theobold request to be teleported to Windhelm the next morning.</p>
<p class="a">An old man tending a garden in the manor's courtyard directs Shiera to the study when she indicates she is there to see Fate.  Shiera is reunited with her sister, who appears to be eleven years old.  When asked about this, Fate shows a chalkboard covered with complex formulae.</p>
<p class="a">Akara and Sir Reginald rejoin the party as the others enter the manor.</p>
<p class="a">Tinkerbell senses that Fate has divination magic on her person, and pockets of necromantic energy in the study.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin, registering that everything about the study is wholly un-natural, leaves the room after splashing holy water on Fate, which has no effect.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold assesses the items in the room for magical properties, focusing on the necromantic items.  Fate follows at a respectful distance.</p>
<p class="a">Fate sees Akara behind the group and looks terrified, asking "Who are you?".  Stolovold replies with just his first name, and briefly examines a book titled 'Edmund's Fundamentals of Applied Necromantic Priciples or a Treatise on the Nature of Infusing Motive Energies into Deceased Matter'.</p>
<p class="a">The group is offered a meal from the Karlsen clan, and as they gather in the dining hall, Firaliin, Shiera, and Thesa realise some are vampires.</p>
<p class="a">Johann greets Shiera as Fate's sister, welcoming her, and asks blessings of Mara and Stendarr, then provides a bloody meat dish to Thesa whom he addresses as 'honoured wolf-child'.  Everyone else eats standard breakfast fare.</p>
<p class="a">Fate asks Shiera about her travels.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin, creeped out by the twins and bored by the conversation, abruptly leaves to investigate her Falkreath property, passing a mob with pitchforks and torches.</p>
<p class="a">Johann invites everyone after the meal to the lounge to share his youthful travels, which Adrian, Ksenia, and Fate find reasons to avoid.  He presents a dry, terrible-slides-of-my-vacation experience, boring everyone present but Thesa and Akara.  Shiera becomes invisible and sneaks off to explore, first finding a secret passage, harassing the sleeping gardener, then finding a heavy locked door.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin finds a poor widow living near her villa, and destroys the woman's hovel and signs over her property's deed.  The woman is suspicious of Firaliin's magic use.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold converses with Fate, learning she is permanently young due to being made a dhampir by the Karlsens saving her life, and she has been studying this effect ever since she has been able.  Stolovold notices his father's name in a corner of the chalkboard with a partially-complete formula related to one of Jonathan's projects, below the name Ha'zhar, a mutual acquaintence of Fate and Jonathan at the Mage's College of Winterhold.
A blue orb begins flashing along with a chiming sound, indicating Shiera's entry into the heavy door.</p>
<p class="a">Fate rushes down to investigate and sees nothing, as Shiera is invisible, jumping in startlement when she reappears behind her.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera relates their uncle's misdeeds, and Fate explains that she had sent Theobold's ashes with a group found by the uncle after hearing Shiera was rumoured to be in Skyrim.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold researches the Karlsen family's history.</p>
<p class="a">The party assembles in the dining hall, Johann leaving to attend the matter of the approaching mob.</p>
<p class="a">Reality freezes, and Akatosh appears to give another gift to the party members, a gem embedded in the character's chest with the ability to teleport to the party or the ship once per day ('Dragon's Cave').</p>
<p class="a">Thesa is teleported outside, and before she returns, Fate asks the party about their histories, taking careful notes.</p>
<p class="a">Tink glows purple, and she and the party switch sizes.</p>
<p class="a">A cat grabs Angelina, Sir Reginald, and Thesa and carries them to the end of the hall.</p>
<p class="a">During the party's attempt to reunite, Shiera finds miniscule dwarven spiders, and the party encounters a strange group of objects that seem to be the playthings of the twins.</p>
<p class="a">The party returns to normal size, and are called outside.  The mob has attacked, impaled and beheaded Johann, his last words being "Don't hurt them!"</p>
<p class="a">The mob confronts the party, and Tazam&eacute; steps forward, freezing time and fighting Akara and attacking Firaliin before releasing the time-stop.</p>
<p class="a">The mob, incited by Stolovold, sets fire to the manor.  Fate rushes into the burning structure, followed by Shiera.</p>
<p class="a">Akara incinerates the mob.</p>
<p class="a">Fate sees a document in Fate's belongings titled 'Invasion Records' stamped by the High King of Skyrim with images of Moonglade properties and Akara.</p>
<p class="a">Dwemer metal containers in Fate's laboratory are split open, releasing a gritty mist.</p>
<p class="a">The building begins to collapse, endangering the lives of both the five-year-old daughter of the butler and Fate, only one of which Shiera can save.  Shiera saves Fate, who is overcome by amnesia which Shiera heals, and the butler sets fire to himself in grief.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera teleports the surviving inhabitants of the Karlsen manor to the safety of the ship.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera confronts Akara, who freely admits to her involvement in the destruction of the Moonglade kingdom as part of Solitude's campaign of conquest.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera teleports to Solitude to confront the High King&ndash;who is not present, so teleports to Windhelm to seek information as to the High King's wherabouts from the Jarl, but learns nothing.  She returns to the Starstreak and teleports Theobold and Jenna to Windhelm.</p>
<p class="a">Jenna is reunited with her parents, and as Anna is interrogated concerning having presumed Jenna dead, Shiera reveals Jenna's combat skill.</p>
<p class="a">The Jarl uses this opportunity to test Jenna in an all-out duel, which she succeeds in gaining the upper hand before its conclusion.</p>
<p class="a">A great feast is held to celebrate Jenna's return and her heretofore-hidden prowess.</p>
<p class="a">Akara perceives strange, glowing geometric patterns cascading through the flames and relates this to the group.</p>
<p class="a">Akara, Firaliin, and Sir Reginald extinguish the remaining fire, as a result scattering the debris over two square miles.</p>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 15</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold searches for and reconstructs the fragments of Fate's chalkboard, deciphering its contents as relating to a method of imbuing a near-dead individual with permanent vitality by casting a complex series of carefully-constructed spells in conjunction with alchemical processes.  It is unclear why a much simpler direct necromantic or ressurection spell would not be used to achieve a similar effect.</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald spies the ghost of a farmer in the distance and destroys it, then turns his attention to a pack of wolves attacking a nearby farm's flock of sheep.</p>
<p class="a">Angelina goes to sleep, overcome by the strain of her metamorphosis and the day's events.</p>
<p class="a">Thesa, before retiring for the night, indicates a desire to return to her hometown to apprise them of her travels and ensure its safety.</p>
<p class="a">Akara confronts Fate, demanding to know what she had done that affected the fire, and Fate explains the details of one of her experiments, Dwemer worker drones vastly miniaturised that function in concert to repair anything in their environment&ndash;ideally to better the world by eliminating such plights as death, hunger, disease, et cetera.  Significantly, the experiment is unfinished as Fate does not know how to make the automata reach a halting state, leaving them to adapt to new environments and progressively augment everything to an undetermined conclusion.</p>
<p class="a">Akara's shocked and defeated reaction to Fate is seen by Firaliin, who forces Fate to also tell her.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera returns to the ship with Tolca after receiving a sense of foreboding from her ancestors and learns about what's happening.</a>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald slays wolves attacking a flock of sheep, the sheep, then tames the wolf pack's alpha.</a>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 16</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, the group discusses ways to combat the nano plague.</a>
<p class="a">Knaz creates a field that repels dust while trying to design a cloaking device, and augments the ship's shields to banish the nanites from the group and ship.</a>
<p class="a">The party investigates a cavern that opens up near the ship with a magical grove and a lifewater pond that rejuvenates those it touches.</a>
<p class="a">Akara drags the party members underwater, and they de-age.</a>
<p class="a">Firaliin examines an underwater nest, Shiera and Thesa investigate a chamber with a sarcophagus containing a ruby sword that vanishes, and Stolovold examines the lake bed.</a>
<p class="a">The party acquires magical items from the lake bed, then finds an altar beyond the grove of trees that grants each a +4 water damage blessing to one weapon.</a>
<p class="a">The group returns to the ship at noon, and the cavern closes.</a>
<p class="a">Shiera remembers the Solitude Captain of the Guard had requested a meeting and teleports to Solitude.</a>
<p class="a">Shiera encounters a Thalmor agent on arrival, then spends several hours seeking the Captain of the Guard before finally contacting an Imperial legate who has information regarding the meeting&ndash;it is disclosed that there is a secret Imperial base in Blackreach assembling a fleet of airships to fight the Daedra.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera scries the location of the High King, who is seated at a table, alone in a dim room, complaining about being made to wait.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin begins to physically express signs of unease, which Alis tries to ease.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold discusses the details of the miniature Dwemer spiders with Fate, and Fate indicates concern about the Mages College after her couriers were turned away from Winterhold just for bringing up the subject of the College.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera returns to the ship and the group discusses providing assistance to the Imperials.</p>
<p class="a">The decision is made to have Vlad control the levitation engine for one Imperial airship, and for the group to go to Eshnium.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera recalls a divinatory trance revealing information about the current situation in Falkreath.</p>
<p class="a">Fate suggests Shiera use her reality stone to remove the small Dwemer spiders, which she does, affecting a 5 mile radius.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera recalls going to Solitude and Windhelm before Knaz used the shield modification.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin uproots Wisteria's friend in a fit of jealousy and throws it off the ship, and Lora replants it after mentioning Firaliin and Heath used to love plants so much.</p>
<p class="a">Fate bitterly supposes it would be better to destroy all remnants of her work after Shiera asks about salvaging anything, as neither remember the miniaturised Dwemer spiders but all of Fate's experiments were destroyed.</p>
<p class="a">As the sun sets, Ksenia is reunited with her owl Hedwig and assures Fate there is yet hope for rebuilding.</p>
<p class="a">As Lora replants the tree, Petra solemnly buries Johann's body beneath it and the surviving Karlsens and Eldea refugees gather to mourn.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin plants and tends to Wisteria to bond the staff to her, Alis guiding Lora elsewhere to allow the druid privacy for intimacy.</p>
<p class="a">Petra dedicates the rebuiling of the manor to centre around the tree as a symbol of everlasting hope and solidarity and sends people to gather resources.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera and Ksenia engage Fate in a tickle attack.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera goes for Fate's feet, and the girl lets out a shriek so loud that Shiera takes damage and Ksenia turns into a bat in startlement and falls to the ground, stunned.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera picks up Ksenia, not realising it's the vampire transformed, and considers taking her as a new pet.  Ksenia objects, asking if Fate has ever had a pet bat before.  Shiera inadvertently refers to Tink in response, infuriating the pixie.  Fate is overcome by a fit of giggling.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin and Stolovold rejoin Shiera, Tink, Fate, and Ksenia, the others noticing that Firaliin is...positively glowing.</p>
<p class="a">Some banter ensues, and Shiera asks if Fate or Ksenia had encountered any faeries.</p>
<p class="a">After Fate and Ksenia find a half-burnt book with partial words under 'Faerie Panacea':  'Nirnr', 'Argonian s', and 'glow du', the group and Tink swap sizes again.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera realises she can use her reality stone without expending a charge to restore the manor from the existing rubble and their normal sizes because reality is not being altered in a meaningful way, and does so.</p>
<p class="a">The restored book reads 'Nirnroot, Argonian spirilla, glow dust, and the heart of an innocent child'.</p>
<p class="a">Petra presents Firaliin with a (non-magical) Karlsen signet pin assuring assistance when in need and an extravagant dress in gratitude.</p>
<p class="a">Fate and Petra ask Akara to fetch Theobold's scimitars and Elsa's crown from the ruins of Elderlan.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera takes the heart from the girl that died instead of Fate after the body is blessed by a priest of Standarr and given peace.</p>
<p class="a">The group heads toward the shore of Lake Ilinalta to find the Nirnroot needed for the panacea, and dispatches a colony of blood bats en route (500 XP).</p>
<p class="a">Asking Ksenia about nearby burial sites, Shiera learns of a cairn and heads that direction.  The group stumbles upon a hermit in a tent.</p>
<p class="a">The group reaches the cairn and encounters a female ghost, who provides them with glow dust.</p>
<p class="a">The group goes into the crypt and pays respect to the dead (Fate leaves a quill, Ksenia a polished bloodstone, Shiera a dagger, and Firaliin a circle of her hair clippings around five drops of her blood), then Shiera prepares the medicine for Tink and gives it to her.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold goes to his section of the vault on the ship and links a sapphire to his bag, then goes to meet the others.</p>
<p class="a">After Stolovold meets them, Shiera tries to play some pranks on him, to his unamusement.  The group returns to the ship and manor.</p>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 17</p>
<p class="a">In the morning after breakfast and learning some about Atmora's status from Tolca, Shiera interrogates the Daedric scout from the Deadlands in the brig and learns General Berith in charge of northern High Rock invasion.</p>
<p class="a">After Akara returns from Atmora (having used her time-manipulation ability to do so), Fate asks her to present the scimitars and crown to Shiera, who is overwhelmed by emotion at seeing the artifacts.</p>
<p class="a">As Akara leaves, the ship is rocked by a massive explosion centering on the vault, and everyone is knocked unconscious.</p>
<p class="a">The party is overcome by a sensation of utter isolation and vast emptiness while unconscious.</p>
<p class="a">When the party awakens in the midafternoon, they discover most of their posessions and ship's stores are gone, including the ship's power core.</p>
<p class="a">While Shiera plots revenge on the thief and Firaliin rants about the loss, Alis sobs and clings to Firaliin in a near-catatonic state.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin uses her druidic abilities to communicate with Wisteria, who saw part of the events that took place&ndash;a brilliant flash from Akara's amulet, an explosion, and a figure dressed in otherworldly armour.</p>
<p class="a">Sir Reginald and his wolf companion go outside and attempt to right the ship, followed by Thesa who asks the manor's residents to help.</p>
<p class="a">A boy phases in and out of existance through the ship, then appears for a moment among the group and touches the Daedra's food bowl, vanishing with the vessel.</p>
<p class="a">Shiera releases the Daedra from the brig on the condition he never disturb the Wayfarers again.</p>
<p class="a">Firaliin goes outside and learns the wood of the ship's hull is made of petrified Princess wood.  She gets aid from local oak trees to make needed planks and imbues Thesa with strength to bend the metal back into place.  Thesa cuts herself on the metal but Angelina heals her.</p>
<p class="a">With the sun setting, Petra arrives and, having learned of the situation from the manor's residents and Olga, suggests the group make a shopping trip to Half Moon Mill.</p>
<p class="a">On the way to the mill, the group encounters a strange airship crewed by individuals seeking Aztlan, hailing 'For Queen and Council!' after Stolovold provides the general direction remembered from the globe in the ship's navigation room.</p>
<p class="a">Wisteria has a swing at Stolovold for handing out information so freely, and Alis has a strange reaction to the mention of the Council, finally telling Stolovold of the group seeking to control and enslave different existences.</p>
<p class="a">Further down the road, the group comes upon a farmstead under attack by skeletal zombies, which are quickly dispatched (500 XP).</p>
<p class="a">The farmers give 20 silver pieces to each of the group in gratitude, and offer to let them stay the night.</p>
<p class="date">303 Rain's Hand 18</p>
<p class="a">In the morning, the Karlsen vampires had left a note indicating that they went on ahead to Half Moon Mill, and Stolovold is missing, but his shoes are still there.</p>
<p class="a">The frail daughter of the farmers sees the glowing adolescent girl and says "It's you.  I guess it's time, huh?" to much confusion.  A seemingly beyond-mortally-wounded farmer enters, noting he had a rough night.</p>
<p class="a">Outside, a pair of winged beings descend from the sky, look at Angelina with disgust, and scold the glowing girl for neglecting her duties and misplacing her scythe.  They state they will bring her and Akara's charge back to where they belong, and after drawing out the wounded farmer's soul, summon a scythe and give it to the glowing girl and instruct her to do her duty before they leave.</p>
<p class="a">Upon taking the scythe, the glowing girl becomes distraught and apologises to the farmers and the frail girl, passing the scythe over her and harvesting her soul, then leaving with the angels along with Akara's charge.</p>
<p class="a">Meridia directly summons Akara and Sir Reginald for attack.</p>
<p class="a">The subdued Wayfarers are asked by the mourning farmers to leave, and they proceed to Half Moon Mill, meeting with Shiera and the Karlsens at the inn around dusk.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold spends time in an isolated room and is presented with an offer by a familiar individual.</p>
<p class="a">Spring Willow meets the group and expresses interest in joining.</p>
<p class="a">Lora and Firaliin reminisce about their time in the orphanage in Ivarstead.</p>
<p class="a">Stolovold is tempted by the Council of the Multitude Spheres and provided tools to be their agent.</p>

<p class="a">Ma'Tsani the Aetherial, an eight-year-old Khajiit on her way from Senchal in Pa'alatiin to perform final qualifications for acceptance into the Mages College at Winterhold, is apparently the only survivor of a shipwreck off Dunbarrow in Skyrim.  The Argonians Spring Willow and Razeer find her and take her to the Pearled Cog, the local tavern.</p>
<p class="a">Ma'Tsani begs for assistance to find her mother, who was on the ship with her.  Razeer searches the beach and finds the woman, seriously wounded, and returns with her to the tavern.  The local healer, a Breton named Beredal, is retrieved and tends to Ma'Tsani's mother's immediate wounds, but notes that the Khajiit's mind is astray.</p>
<p class="a"><div class="retcon">Ma'Tsani suggests getting help from the Mages College, which Beredal notes is a fortnight's sail away and likely to be not as troubled by the Daedra as Solitude.</div></p>
<p class="a"><div class="retcon">The group decides to travel by foot, and sets off along the road, encountering a lone half-orc miner at the end of the first day, and forest trolls around noon the third day after that.</div></p>

<p class="a">Firaliin and Thesa meet Razeer in Whiterun and encounter Heath Ledger, Firaliin's childhood friend, who is falsely accused of theft by the town guard but released after showing paperwork.  Razeer kills Oglaf Wolftooth, a minor town guard.</p>
<p class="a">Heath relates the current status of Ivarstead; Mother Beatty head of a cult, Temple of Mara desecrated, Richard Shiv sherriff and under thumb of Beatty.</p>
