Timothy Robert Cook is a reclusive individual whose interests cover a wide range of fields, though significant
depth of knowledge in any given subject is limited due to a combination of poor memory and lack of motivation.
He presently lives in the United States in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.

Born at <a href="http://loyolamedicine.org/">Loyola University Medical Center</a> in Maywood, Illinois on 23
July 1979 at 19:48 UTC, the third child and only son in a family of five, he was about ten weeks premature and
weighed two pounds, two ounces (960 g).  Almost ten and a half weeks were spent after birth in intensive care.
Between being fitted with glasses at one and a half years old, having an adenoidectomy and tubes inserted in
both ears almost one and a half years later, glasses prescription changed to bifocals at age three and
a half, and violent fever in reaction to DTP innoculation at five among various other incidents, early
childhood was not easy.  To correct for developmental lag, he was enrolled in physical therapy at the Easter
Seal Rehabilitation Center in Aurora, Illinois; the activities were successfully completed before enrolling in
elementary school.  In fifth grade he contracted mononucleosis and was homebound for several weeks; after he
recovered, overall physical ability and motivation to engage in activity was significantly reduced and never
fully recovered to earlier levels.  On 25 December 1998, while travelling with his mother and one of his sisters
to visit relatives in Iowa, the car in which they were driving was involved in a head-on collision with another;
only Tim and a passenger in the other vehicle survived.  Tim was treated at the
<a href="http://www.uihealthcare.com/index.html">University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics</a> until 8 January
1999.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
Tim was raised in <a href="http://www.cityofbatavia.net">Batavia, Illinois</a>, attending
<a href="http://lws.bps101.net/">Louise White Grade School</a> starting in 1986, then proceeding to McWayne
Sixth Grade Center, <a href="http://rms.bps101.net/">Batavia Middle School</a>, and
<a href="http://bhs.bps101.net/">Batavia High School</a>.  After graduating in 1998, he enrolled as an
Illustration major at <a href="http://www.niu.edu">Northern Illinois University</a>.  Overall,
throughout his education, his scores tended towards mediocre, being notably higher on tests than everyday
assignments which required a higher level of dedication and perserverance.  A break was taken after the car accident,
during which Tim was employed shelving books on a part-time basis at the Batavia Public Library.  In autumn of 1999,
Tim returned to NIU for three semesters, completing two full years of earned credit, but failing to adapt to the
needs of a social lifestyle and passing among several dorm rooms, in each instance ending in a single-occupant setting.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
At the end of the year in 2000, an offer was presented by some aquaintences, one known since elementary school,
to move to Merritt Island, Florida and share a house.  Less than six months later, they abruptly left without
warning.  Tim then rented out a small apartment in Rockledge, another property owned by the landlady of the house
in Merritt Island, where he remained for two years.  At the suggestion of a new acquaintence, in mid-2003 Tim
moved to <a href="http://www.cityoforlando.net">Orlando</a>, in an effort to experience more
of life instead of being a <i>de facto</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
However, due to continued lack of motivation and social skills, no real progress was made in this direction, a
state exacerbated by being bilked of a sizable fraction of his finances by individuals claiming good intentions.
Frustrated at his situation, at the end of 2006 he moved to another residence in Orlando, followed merely half
a year later by a move to Oviedo as a reaction to overly-aggressive behaviour exhibited by his new housemate.  Once
more, at the end of 2007, prompted by general financial difficulties and decision of the owner of the house's son to
finish his education, Tim moved to a trailer park in Gainesville, Florida, where his unsociable lifestyle reasserted
itself with force.  In May 2008, the roommate with whom he had moved from Oviedo decided to move to
Washington state, and on 17 June, the person from whom he was renting a room was arrested and all computers at
the residence were seized, including those belonging to Tim.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
Subsequent negligible human interaction amplified various traits of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder">schizoid personality disorder</a> that had
previously been present (as noted by a physician when Tim was hospitalized at UIHC).  In June 2009, he was invited
back to Oviedo to resume renting the room he'd previously occupied for substantially less money than he was paying in
Gainesville, an offer he accepted, and after inquiring about his as-yet-unreturned computer and being informed that the
Sheriff's Office does not ordinarily return any seized hardware, moved at the end of the month.  During a visit to
relatives in April 2010, he was invited to Wayland, Iowa to live with his sister's family, which he accepted and moved
in mid-August.  Two contributing factors to this decision were the hope that the move would provide a much-needed jolt
to and venue for social interaction, and the proximity of Brighton, Iowa, the location of the cemetery where many of
his relatives are buried; worries over his own inevitable fate were never wholly out-of-mind when he lived in Florida.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
Wayland's small size and distance from other communities combined with significant interpersonal dissonance at his new
residence led Tim to be even more socially distant than he was in Florida, with 2012 and 2013 marking a new low point
in his life.  Idealogical differences between Tim and his sister's family came to a head in May of 2015, resulting in
his expulsion from their residence and a frantic search for a new place to live, viable source of income, and basic
skills needed to cope with the fears that act as primary motivation for him.  Speedy assistance in these tasks was
provided by a number of individuals and institutions, including Hope Haven in Burlington, Iowa, though the process of
social rehabilitation is always a much longer, arduous journey for anyone, and one some never fully complete.

		<div class="content">
			<p class="a">
<a href="http://www.similarminds.com">Enneagram</a> type is 5, self-preservation variant,
and Myers Briggs Jung type is INTJ.  His blood type is B positive, clearly at odds with the supposed traits
associated with that blood type in the popular culture of Japan&mdash;being wild, active, and strong, while
unforgiving and selfish&mdash;while the Sheep of the Chinese zodiac suggests creativity, and ability in the
arts, and in the Western Zodiac he is a Cancer-Leo cusp, suggesting a loyal, self-aborbed, generous, and
pretentious individual.
Politically, around 2012, his views were left-leaning libertarian (-5.75, -2.36) on the
<a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org">Political Compass</a> chart, and had shifted slightly to (-4.88, -2.26)
by 2014.
Religiously, he was raised Christian.  Augmented by a sense of curiosity, desire for hope, and slightly cynical
pragmatism, his current beliefs are most aligned with the Liberal Quakers, and the sentiment that one's religious
views are a wholly personal matter, not the concern of others.  Personal and awareness of global events have shaped
his mindset that an interventive deity that would favour only a miniscule number of souls at the expense of untold
suffering of the vast majority cannot be reasonably described as anything but malevolent, relegating a well-intentioned
God to being something of an amoral designer-of-the-universe who does not micromanage individual details.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
Science-fiction and fantasy are his favourite genres of literature and film, and the ready availability of
Japanese animation on the internet has brought a wide variety of entertainment to his attention that he
might otherwise not bother to invest time to pursue.  The poignant story, music, and layers of symbolism
(not to mention personal identification with the character Reki's motivations) that define the series
<a href="http://www.geneon-ent.co.jp/rondorobe/anime/haibane/">&#28784;&#32701;&#36899;&#30431; (Haibane Renmei)</a>
make it his favourite, though equally well-crafted works such as
<a href="http://5cm.yahoo.co.jp">&#31186;&#36895;5&#12475;&#12531;&#12481;&#12513;&#12540;&#12488;&#12523;
(5 cm per Second)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi">&#34802;&#24107; (Mushishi)</a>, and
<a href="http://www.tokuma.co.jp/coil/">&#38651;&#33075;&#12467;&#12452;&#12523; (Dennou Coil)</a>, with their
depictions of the powerful, yet often painful beauty of the world and youthful emotions, are held in as much
esteem.  Similarly, the manga <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D">
&#12520;&#12467;&#12495;&#12510;&#36023;&#12356;&#20986;&#12375;&#32000;&#34892; (Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou)</a> conveys a
wistful, nostalgic atmosphere, and the music of <a href="http://www.enya.com">enya</a> accompanies and enhances
this sensation with a calming subtlety.
			</p>
			<p class="a">
Distaste of the coarseness and negative aspects of physical and power-driven interaction between humans have led him to
prefer the aesthetics of subtlety and gracefulness on a conceptual level, his interest in beauty being one of admiration
from afar of an ideal that is ephemeral and untouchable (a large influence on his interest in mermaids as subjects for
drawing).  The combined aversion to social interaction and the mechanics of physical intimacy have resulted in a
celibate lifestyle, perhaps more by circumstance than by choice, with a gender identity aligning more with grey
asexuality than any other, and a marked disinterest in engaging with and participating in communities even when aligned
with his own interests.
