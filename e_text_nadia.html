<p><!-- 1979-Jul-23 --><b>2444078.20:  New Morning</b></p>
<p>
Now the world tilts and spins, and all around Nadia, blurry shapes make
incomprehensible gestures and shout with deafening voices.  She is lifted high
into the air, terror and vertigo crowding her mind, and she screams an unending
wail of anguish.  Blunt objects prod her, then she is pinched by something
harder and more frigid than anything she has known.  Unable to make sense of her
surroundings, she flails about, quickly exhausting herself.  Darkness and sleep
wrap around her, carrying her mind to a quieter place.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1983-Nov-29 --><b>2445668: Nightmare</b></p>
<p class="int">
Awakened in the middle of the night, Nadia climbs down the steep, moonlit stairs
to the first floor.  The third and fifth steps creak at the slightest weight,
and seem to sag as the girl touches them.  Fearful of their crumbling beneath
her, sending her to her doom, she quickly scrambles past them, sliding her bottom
with a thump to the next, fingers tightly gripping the front of the stair edge
for support.  At the bottom, in the darkness, Nadia stands, reaching up and
turning the wobbly, iron knob of the front door.  The warped, uneven panels,
seemingly held together merely by peeling strips of paint, swing open with a
dull, gritty sort of groan, revealing a vacant city lot, severe in the pale
moonlight.  Nadia backs against the rough plywood hanging from splintering
fenceposts towering ovearhead.  Terrified dismay contorts her features as she
turns to go back into the house she just left, now a blank wall.  Small
upwellings of thick, black fluid dot the rich, uneven earth.  By degrees, they
swell, then burst, erupting upwards as though spat by some grotesque monster
hidden underground.  The stuff begins to fall from the sky, in a vile rain that
cannot be escaped, whose touch can bring nought but death.  Frantic screams fill
the air as a crowd of people mills about in terrified confusion, trying to find
shelter.
</p>
<p>
Nadia whimpers and turns in her sleep, her eyes flickering rapidly behind closed
lids.  Gasping for air, she sits up, shaking and breathing heavily.  There is no
other sound in the house, apart from the metallic creak of her bed as she shifts
her weight.  The pale moonlight shines brightly, serenely, through her window
onto the floor and wall and the weird pattern of shadow quickly coalesces into
the form of twisting, grasping claws.  An eerie cry--a hooting wail--carries
through the air, and a vague, winged thing flies from the branches of the tree
outside.  Nadia bites her lip and draws her blanked to her chin, shivering with
fear and staring fixedly at the ceiling until sleep claims her once more.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1984-Dec-13 --><b>2446078: Failing Intimacy</b></p>
<p>
There is a sound of movement at the doorway of her room, and Nadia looks up from
where she is playing to see her father standing over her.  A hungry look fills
his eyes, and he speaks in a low voice, his voice thick.  "Up in bed, Nadia."
As she climbs onto her bed, she feels a hand gripping her shoulder, turning her
to face the man who now has a wide, toothy grin.  He pushes her back, heedless
of her feeble attempt to resist.  "Just lie back."  She stares at the ceiling,
confused, then afraid, as he draws down her pants and lowers his head between
her legs.  An ill-defined urge to urinate, along with a brief nausea, washes
over her in a wave as he sucks and works his tongue.  Finishing his endeavour,
her father stands and gives her an exaggerated wink before turning and leaving.
Benumbed by what has just happened, with no sense of how to react, Nadia simply
pulls up her pants, turns off the light, and goes to bed, fully clothed.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1985-Jun-12 --><b>2446221: Twilight Bird</b></p>
<p>
Cautiously, Nadia picks her way through the undergrowth outside the stone cabin
nestled in the woods that surround a deep lake with clear azure water.  The
muffled sound of loud conversation mixes indistinctly with strains of piano
music and closer racket of unseen chirping birds.  Pretending not to hear when
her name is called out, the girl quickens her pace.  Finally enveloped by quiet
as she enters a small clearing, Nadia slows to a halt, breathing heavily.  As
she looks around, she turns in a circle, eyes darting to and fro, eagerly
absorbing with wonder the sight of untamed wilderness.  With a sigh, Nadia
settles down upon a large rock, neatly spreading her dress to her sides and
staring at the clouds passing overhead, a look of contentment becalming her
features.  Slowly, her eyes close and she drifts off to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Vivid orange light fills the sky when she wakes, the setting sun glittering on
the lake just visible through gaps in the trees.  Sneezing, Nadia sits up and
blinks, trying to recall where she is.  Groggily, she stands and stumbles toward
the direction from which she came.  Crying out in surprise, the young girl jumps
back as something at her feet thrashes about, making a discordant warbling
noise.  Nadia crouches to get a closer look, and finds herself staring directly
in the bright eyes of a wounded hawk.  It cheeps softly at her, flinching as she
reaches out to pet the soft feathers.  In the dying light, Nadia frowns as she
feels something sticky, and withdraws her hand, sniffing at it then gagging as
the odour of rotting meat fills her nostrils.  Eyes wide with terror, she
watches transfixed as the bird gasps twice, shudders, then is still, its eyes
clouding.  Tears streaming down her face, Nadia stumbles blindly through the
bushes, falling backwards as she runs into a tall person.  With a quick
movement, the adult's arm reaches out and grabs her, restoring her balance.  An
angry, loud voice drives into Nadia's head, reprimanding her for wandering off,
demanding to know where she has been.  Overwhelmed, hungry, and drained, Nadia
collapses.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1986-Jan-28 --><b>2446459: Yellow Flare</b></p>
<p>
Bleak and cheerless, the early-morning light shines through the bare branches of
clusters of trees, glittering on the new-fallen snow that covers the ground.
Shivering in the frigid air, Nadia sits huddled in the back seat of a beat-up
Zastava and stares at the grey road winding through the sparse forest.  When the
small car leaves the wooded area, the sun is high in the sky, blinding rays
flooding the desolate landscape, combining with the rhythmic motion of the
vehicle to lull the young girl into a hazy state of drowsiness.  As the road
begins to curve around a dry lake bed, a low rumble, growing to a constant
thunder, stirs Nadia, and she looks around, blinking sleepily.  In fearful
wonder, her mouth drops open as her view finally settles on a blazing yellow
flare, climbing above the western horizon on a thin column of white smoke.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1987-Aug-16 --><b>2447024: Lost Trust</b></p>
<p>
"This is a secret -- you can't ever tell anybody" her father rasps with a
conspiratorial whisper, a sickly smile creeping onto his face.  Nadia stands in
her parents' room on a lazy summer afternoon, summoned by the only other person
in the house for most of the day.  He does not even bother to close the door
behind him.  "Hurry, before your mother gets home...say, take off those
clothes."  Frowning as the girl hesitates, he speaks sharply, in a tone that
brooks no argument.  "Now."  There is not even the possibility of contemplating
disobediance; she reacts on pure impulse.  Sullenly, Nadia disrobes and stands
naked before the grinning man.  "Lie down...there.  On your stomach.  Like
that."  The bed creaks and shifts as her father climbs into it beside her.
Nadia lies there, glassy eyes unfocused, staring at the wall as her father turns
into her back, pulling her close.  The dull ache filling her abdomen, merely a
cheap immitation of the sensation of needing to move one's bowels, is
insignificant compared to the tight knot of resentment constricting her heart,
and she clenches her teeth, waiting for it to be over, for solitude to be
returned to her, untroubled by the intrusions of others.  Her father's voice
rasps harshly in her ear, a grunting chuckle.  "Too bad...you weren't a boy."
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1987-Sep-01 --><b>2447040: Spark</b></p>
<p>
Nadia slides onto the only remaining bus seat, nervously glancing at the other
occupant for several minutes.  The ridiculously ornate dress covered with frills
and large, ribbon-bedecked straw hat, along with neatly-braided shining coppery
hair, gives the petite girl a decidedly porcelain doll-like appearance.  She
looks back at Nadia with large, soulful eyes and smiles, dimples appearing on
her rosy cheeks.
</p>
<p>
"Whee!  Somebody will sit with Sofiya!" she exclaims, clapping her tiny hands.
"What's your name?" she asks, her voice faint and airy.
</p>
<p>
"I...um, Nadia" stammers Nadia, blushing, unused to anybody attempting to
converse with her.
</p>
<p>
"How beautiful!"  Sofiya clasps Nadia's hand in her
own.  "Did you know your name means 'hope', Nadenka?  It does."  She looks out
the window as the bus passes through a copse of trees.  "Sofiya hopes that
Nadenka can become Sofiya's dear friend."
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1987-Nov-05 --><b>2447105: Companion</b></p>
<p>
Weary of the chaotic din of conversations between the other students, her head
throbbing with pain, Nadia reduces her pace, dropping behind the group several
metres, then turns and slips between the thick foliage into the forest.  Pushing
through ferns and clumps of hanging moss, she walks for many minutes, peering
about, looking for a clearing in which to rest.  A low rumble overhead makes her
pause and glance at the dark clouds gathering overhead.  Sitting on a large
half-fallen tree trunk, Nadia leans against it and closes her eyes, relaxing in
the cool breeze.  She flinches slightly as a peal of thunder rolls across the
sky, then abruptly turns to find the source of a small cry behind her.  The
leaves of some bushes rustle, then part to reveal Sofiya, carrying her parasol
lightly in one hand and holding her frilly dress with the other, trying to keep
it from getting any more damp than it already is.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Nadenka," she gasps, pausing to catch her breath, "Sofiya was afraid she
had lost you, and was ever so worried!"  Nadia exhales slowly, closing her eyes
and clearing her throat to speak.  With an electric squeal and blinding flash, a
bolt of lightning stabs through the sky overhead, followed by an eerie silence.
Both girls scream and jump in terror, Sofiya flinging herself at Nadia.  Rain
streams out of the belly of the cloud, utterly drenching everything beneath.
Overwhelmed by the sudden innundation, Sofiya and Nadia dive beneath the large
moss-covered mass of wood and huddle together, shivering.  Sofiya clutches her
parasol, holding it above herself and Nadia in a futile attempt to ward off some
of the water.  Whimpering, they stare out at the downpour, greyness obscuring
the vivid blue-green landscape and transmogrifying the atmosphere into a
roiling, breathing beast.  Groaning and creaking, the branches of the
surrounding trees sway back and forth in the violent gusts of wind, crashing
into each other with dissonant claps.  Then, just as suddenly as it started, the
precipitation ceases, ghostly tendrils of mist rising from the saturated earth,
filling the air with a pungent, rich aroma.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1987-Nov-06 --><b>2447106: Consequences</b></p>
<p>
A dismal, autumn rain drips from the low grey clouds and slithers down the
short, tinted windows high in the brick walls of the school's main office.  Webs
of red and blue light lance through the twisting rivulets and slide in bizarre
patterns along the wall.  Fidgeting nervously, a young girl sits on a long bench
in the waiting room.  The murmur of conversation behind the closed door before
her is barely audible over the hum of the air conditioning and fluorescent
lights.  Slowly, the hands of the clock inch along their path, the thin red
second hand seeming to take ages to pass between the small markings.  Hunching
her shoulders, the girl brushes a few tangled strands of straw-coloured hair
from in front of her eyes and allows her gaze to wander over the room's spartan
furnishings.  Behind her, a large window extends from floor to ceiling and from
one side of the room to the other, interrupted by a door  to her right leading
out to the main hallway.   A flag hangs from a brass pole to the left of the
reception window in the wall across from her, and a fake plant sits in a large
pot at the end of the bench.  Other than a framed photo of a balding, fat man
wearing a military uniform standing in front of a cathedral, the cement-block
walls are bare.  Tilting her head to one side, the girl idly picks at the
cracked pea-green vinyl padding on the bench.  Small flecks of dried blood rub
off her fingers and stain the exposed yellow foam.  With a start, she jerks her
hand away as the inner office door opens, revealing a severe woman with pinched
features and glasses, and two police officers.  As the woman strides briskly
towards her, the girl jumps up, standing rigidly, clasping her hands behind her
back.  Swallowing, she steals a glance at the police as the woman scrutinizes
the girl's bloodstained shirt and narrows her eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Nadia," she says, voice low and dangerous.  Nadia's breath quickens as the
woman glances at the police and nods slightly.  With a studied air of
indifference, the officers turn and look at their paperwork, ignoring both girl
and woman.  Nadia tenses, but the sting of the first slap burns on her cheek
before she even notices the movement of her mother's hand.  The second blow
sends her halfway across the room, tumbling to the floor, giving a short cry of
pain.  Roughly, the tall woman grabs the girl's arm and pulls her back up,
shoving her towards the door.  Dragging her to a small blue car, the woman
pushes Nadia inside, slamming the door behind her.
</p>
<p>
Heart pounding, her throat  tight as she fights to hold back hot tears, Nadia
stares unseeing at the scenery as they drive through the heavy rain falling
over the city.  Eventually, the sound of the car motor ceases, and she slowly
opens the door and steps onto a cracked, cement driveway.  Nadia rushes to stay
close to her mother as she enters the two-story house, but the woman quickly
closes the door behind her, leaving the young girl standing, shivering in the
cold.  Tears spill over and run down her cheeks, mingling with the rain as she
sinks to the ground and sits, hugging her knees to her chest.  As the sun slips
below the horizon, the door opens behind her and she turns at a loud sound of
disgust.
</p>
<p>
"You're still out here?  You really are a worthless pile of garbage.  As soon as
you're eighteen, we're no longer legally responsible for you, and you're on your
own.  Get to your room," spits her mother, who steps around the child and gets
in the car, driving away.  Shakily, Nadia stands and turns the knob, falling
inside as the unlocked door swings open.  Sniffling, she closes it behind her
and half-crawls into the small living room.  A moment later, she frowns in
confusion, for she now stands in the kitchen next to the counter.  In a daze,
she reaches out and closes the drawer of knives someone had left open.  Slowly,
she turns and makes her way across the house, wearily climbing upstairs.
Entering her cramped room, she sits on her bed and stares at the water-stained,
peeling wallpaper.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1991-Sep-01 --><b>2448501: Grey Morning</b></p>
<p>
Nadia leans drowsily against the shower wall, the searing-hot water cascading
down her body, its sharp pinpricks bite into her bare flesh.  She flinches and
rubs her eyes to rid them of sleep, then yawns.  The girl is startled awake as
the stream of water shoots into her mouth, making her sputter and shake her head
wildly, then thrust out her hand.  She howls with pain as her wrist smashes into
the valve of the tap.  Whimpering, tears streaming down her face, Nadia stumbles
out of the tiny bathroom, nursing her injured limb, and falls into her bedroom.
A few minutes later, she sits up, shivering as the moisture covering her bare
skin evaporates.  Hugging herself, Nadia rushes into the bathroom and grabs a
towel to wrap it around her body before firmly grasping the spigot in the shower
and turning off the water.
</p>
<p>
Nadia stands next to the small table beside her bed and places her hand on a few
loose forms that lay upon it, moving the top paper aside so she can see the
schedule printed on the one beneath.  Driven by a sudden impulse, she leans over
to the window and pushes aside the heavy curtain, squeezing her eyes shut and
turning her head as the morning light floods the room.  Wiping grime off of the
cracked pane of glass, Nadia peers into the distance across the Volga to the
other side of the city, towards the clock tower just visible between buildings.
As she struggles to make out the time, the faint peals of the bells chiming the
hour drift through the sky.  Moving her lips as she counts the rings to herself,
Nadia glances at the schedule on the table again, then cries out in alarm.  She
grabs the papers and the half-unpacked shoulder bag on the floor and rushes from
her room, nearly losing her balance as she darts down the stairs, and fleeing
the house, letting the unlocked door close itself behind her.
</p>
<p>
Chilly fog clings to dim corners along the street, hiding from the beams of
sunlight in the shadows of weathered buildings.  Hurrying along a cracked street
beside a sluggish green channel branching from the river, Nadia alternately
looks at a tattered map and cranes her neck, trying to recognize landmarks,
street patterns, and the rare sign legible enough to aid in navigation.  On the
bridge crossing the river, she looks up the southern bank in an effort to find
the building marked on the paper by the text
"&#1064;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1072; #9" and a red circle.  By the time she
reaches the school grounds, her side burns with each breath.  Sweat beading her
forehead, the girl pauses and leans against the brick pillar of the main gate,
legs shaking.  Gagging, Nadia crumples to the ground, hunger and fatigue both
sapping what remains of her strength.  Using the brickwork as a support, she
slowly rises to her feet and staggers across the courtyard, approaching the
metal double doors set with thick panes of glass.  Nadia weakly tugs one open
and slips inside.  For a few moments, she stands in the entry, her eyes slowly
adjusting to the dim light.
</p>
<p>
A long hallway crosses the building; ochre and grey-green linoleum tiles laid in
a checkerboard pattern along the floor gleam dully under flickering fluorescent
panels, and chipped ceramic squares cover the walls in a mosaic of soft hues of
blue.  Running against the wall a few feet inside the doorway is a simple
wood-and-glass trophy case, containing some mediocre awards and medals, faded
photographs of past alumni, and one or two elaborate statuettes.  Doors lead
from the passage at intervals, some opening onto side hallways, others bearing
faded signs.  Nadia passes them slowly, reading each one as she walks down one
side of the corridor then returning, stopping at the main office.  Timidly, she
knocks upon it and enters.  Inside, she slides the forms she has been given
across a counter to a bored-looking clerk.  Yawning, the wrinkled man puts on a
pair of spectacles and rubs his hand over the top of his bald head, then picks
up the papers.  He stares at them for a long while, mumbling, then peers at
Nadia.  Shifting her weight from one foot to the other, she grips her left wrist
tightly and studies the wood grain on the counter.
</p>
<p>
"You'll excuse me, I'll have to talk with the principal," bleats the man, who
then retreats into another room.  Long minutes drag by, and the man returns,
followed by a very short woman with steel-grey hair wrapped tightly into a bun
and dark eyes.  Bristling with authoritative energy, she looks once at the
slender girl.
</p>
<p>
"Come to my office," she barks, jabbing an index finger at Nadia, who follows
the principal into another room with a large desk.  Two plain chairs sit in
front of the desk, and a large, velvet-covered wing chair is behind it.  An
overflowing bookcase stands to the side.  "Sit," commands the elderly woman,
gesturing at one of the plain chairs, then scurrying around the desk and
planting herself upon the large seat which dwarfs her slight figure.  Clasping
her hands before her and leaning foward on the desk, she narrows her eyes.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p>
Rattling loudly, the door to the classroom slides in its track as Nadia opens it
and enters.  Trying to calm her breathing, her heart a tight knot in her breast,
Nadia stands at the front of the room beside the instructor and faces the class.
Whispers and giggles pass among the students, and Nadia self-consciously drops
her gaze, blushing and pressing her arms tightly against her sides.  The searing
rays of midafternoon sunlight lance between the gaps in the drab foliage of the
trees outside and burn in dappled patterns on the students and their desks.
Overhead, decrepit fans wobble and creak as they turn, stirring up a haze of
dust from the chalkboard and window sills.  Buzzing fitfully, the last few
cicadas of the year gather in warm nooks and crannies among the branches near
the windows, their droning harmonizing with, then overwhelming, the instructor's
dull voice.  Nadia begins to close her eyes as an impatient cough startles her
and she jerks, turning her head to see the teacher, looking down his nose at her
with no small amount of disgust, pointing to an empty seat.  Her ears burning
scarlet, Nadia stumbles between the rows of desks, heavy shoes squeaking as they
fall upon the dull, cracked lineoleum floor.
</p>
<!--<hr class="half">-->
<p><!--1992-Oct-12 --><!--<b>2448913: Meeting Absence</b></p>
<p>
The fluorescent lights illuminating the main hallway of the school buzz loudly,
a jarring dischord that makes this area of the building feel even more lonely.
Faintly, from one of the other corridors, the sound of the
student-parent-teacher conferences underscores the solitude.  Nadia slumps
against the metal frame of a half-open door and sighs.  Glancing around once to
reassure herself that nobody is watching, she slips into the darkened gymnasium.
A few of the halogen lamps hanging from the steel girders high overhead glow
with a faint lavender hue, and a lone fixture blazes, pure white, casting a
small pool of light upon the polished wood floor.  Nadia walks to it and stops
just outside the ring, toeing the delineation between light and shade.
</p>
-->
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1995-Sep-01 --><b>2449962: Glimmer</b></p>
<p>
The harsh calls of crows shatter the cool air as a brisk gust of wind sends some
crimson and ochre leaves sailing through the air, then swirling in eddies around
the roots of slender trees whose partly-denuded branches clutch dazzling dresses
of gold and scarlet leaves.  Groups of students bundled up in mufflers and coats
hurry along the sidewalk toward the glass-and-cement fa&#0231;ade of the school.
Well apart from her peers, Nadia slows her walk as she crosses the brick
courtyard in front of the building and looks behind her, shading her eyes from
the bright sunlight shining through gaps in the broken clouds.
</p>
<p>
Nadia frowns and sighs heavily, hefting her bag on her shoulder.  Shuffling her
feet, she steps into the darkness of the school and pauses to allow her sight to
clear.  Irritated by her obstruction, other students grumble loudly and shove
her roughly to the side.  Nadia murmurs halfhearted apologies, and sullenly goes
to her classroom.  A few more students straggle in as the bell rings, and take
their seats.  The teacher, a thin woman with pinched features, begins taking
attendance.  When she reaches Nadia's name, she pauses and twitches a smile.
</p>
<p>
"How good of you to join us once more."  The class titters and several students
sneak glances at Nadia, who hunches forward in her seat, her ears burning with
shame.  "Since you are no doubt familiar with this material, why don't you go to
the blackboard and conjugate the verb 'to pull'."
</p>
<p>
As she turns and heads back to her seat, Nadia pauses, catching her breath as
the cute haircut of the girl a few rows over draws her attention.  She peeks
over as she sits back down, looking more closely at the other student--a slender
young woman with large brown eyes and noble features, her skin a delicate shade
of olive, clear and flawless.

Lightly running across the floor, the gymnast launches herself into a powerful
leap, extending her long, slender limbs and arching her back.  For a long moment
she hangs, motionless, silhouetted by the slanting rays of the setting sun, then
gracefully alights on the ground and turns, sweeping one leg in an elegant arc
behind her.

<p>
Small points of light twinkle in the clear sky, soft ochre on the western
horizon shifting to violet dusk, then darkening to blue-black overhead.  Nadia
shivers as a cool breeze sweeps around her, carrying fragments of crumbling, dry
leaves down the narrow sidewalk.  Quickly, she turns the key in the lock,
opening the door to her house and stepping inside to the relative warmth.
Slipping off her shoes, she pads up to her room and climbs into bed, wrapping
the blankets about her and staring out the window.  Lights from the town glow
cheerily, blurring as her breath fogs the pane of glass.  Nadia tugs the worn
linens closer, huddling under layers of thin cloth, and watches the pale flakes
of snow drift down from the sky, a sad, thoughtful expression on her face.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1997-Apr-26 --><b>2450565: Despair</b></p>
<p>
Numbly, Nadia drops her arm limply to her side.  All but forgotten, the
telephone handset falls from her shaking hand.  Shuddering, she stares blankly
into the distance.  Dimly, through the words echoing in her head that confirm
her existence is worthless and hated, one conclusion forms, absolute in its
simple logic.  Her movements are mechanical, emotionless, as she closes her hand
around the heavy scissors.
</p>
<p>
Long corridors rush past in a blur, the pungent smell of medicine fills her
nostrils.  A fog fills her head, making it difficult to think.  Nadia turns her
head slightly, noting with detachment that her left wrist, throbbing with pain,
is wrapped tightly in gauze.  The bandage hurts, and cuts off circulation so she
can't feel her hand.  Exhaustion sweeps over her, and she begins to loll to one
side.  Shaking her head in great arcs, she tries to lift her left arm, but she
is too weak.  A voice murmurs behind her, and she winces as something jabs her
neck.  Before she can complain, sleep descends.
</p>
<hr class="half">

Sniffling, breath coming in low, quavering rasps, Nadia sits with her bare back
pressed against the wall and wraps her thin arms around her legs, clutching them
to her chest.  Faint grey light shines through the heavy curtains, punctuated by
electric blue flashes which are followed by a loud crack, then deafening rumble.
With each peal of thunder, Nadia flinches, involuntarily clenching her teeth as
her breathing turns to short gasps.  Rain, falling incessantly for the past
week, drums a slow beat on the window, increasing in frequency until there is a
steady dull roar.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere, in a dark corner of the room, large drops of water splash on the
cracked tile floor, staccato dings accenting the endless crescendo of the storm.
A quiet tapping on the door is replaced by several loud knocks, and Nadia tenses,
concentrating as she tries to distinguish what might be a voice from the
background noise of the downpour.  With a click, the handle slowly turns and a
girl shrouded in a hooded raincoat hesitantly pushes the door open.
</p>
<p>
"Nadia?  Ugh...Nadia Quidam?" she calls softly into the gloom, covering her
mouth.  "Are you in here? I'm the class representative..."  Seeing Nadia's
silhouetted form on the bed, she steps inside, wrinkling her nose.  "Eww, it
stinks in here...hey...you haven't been to school for three days now, they sent
me to get you..." she suddenly gags, backing into the hallway and retching,
darting towards the bathroom.  A minute later, she wipes her mouth and leans,
shaking, in the doorway, looking more carefully into the room and at Nadia.
Raising her voice, she speaks unsteadily, "h-how can you live in a place like
th..." she swallows, her voice trails off.  "Just...be in school tomorrow," the
girl finishes, letting the door close behind her, then slamming the front door a
few moments later as she leaves.

<p>
Her chair lurches as the student behind her roughly kicks it, and Nadia snaps
out of her reverie and blinks quickly.  The instructor stands near her desk,
scowling, and several of the other students sit with arms raised.  What did the
teacher say?  Uncertain of what to do, Nadia ducks her head and looks at her
hands, clasping and unclasping them atop her desk.  The girl in the seat behind
her gives a short bark of laughter and reaches for Nadia's wrist and lifts it
over her head.  Nadia wrenches her arm from the girl's grasp and violently
flails about as she lunges from her seat and dives for the back of the room.
Breathing heavily, she presses her back against the wall and brings her knees up
to her chest and wraps her arms beneath her legs, shivering.  The class is
completely silent, and the loud thud-thud of her own heartbeat fills Nadia's
ears, her eyesight dimming.
</p>
<p>
When consciousness finally returns to Nadia, the classroom is empty, and the
shadows have shifted, giving everything a surreal appearance.  Unsteadily, Nadia
tries to stand, but crumples to her side as her aching muscles agonizingly relax
after being strained for so long.  Twitching, she lies on her side, the floor
becoming a wooden wall dropping away, desks jutting out like tree branches and
the door nearby becoming an impossible goal, the top of a sheer cliff.  In a
panic, Nadia flails her limbs, clawing for something on which to hang.  Suddenly
the wave of panic ebbs, and she lurches upright, breathing heavily.  Face hot
with embarrasment, she creeps to the doorway and looks around, exhaling with
relief that nobody has seen her.
</p>
<p>
In the dim light of the late afternoon, Nadia slowly passes through the silent
corridors, running her hand along the cool metal of the narrow lockers that line
them.  Heedless of her destination, she plods forward, shoes occasionally
squeaking on the on mottled earth-tone linoleum and echoing down the long
hallway.  Eventually, she comes to a stop near the infirmary.  She blinks in
surprise and edges closer to the wall as the school nurse, an attractive young
woman in her twenties with dark hair gathered into a tight bun, exits and
glances at her.  Nervously, Nadia grips her left wrist tightly and rubs the
scar, biting her lip at the pain.  The nurse pushes her glasses up her nose and,
slipping her hands into the pockets of her lab coat, peers at Nadia.  Faintly,
the acrid-sweet aroma of rubbing alcohol wafts from the open door by which the
nurse stands.  Overcome by a sudden wave of vertigo and nausea, Nadia whimpers,
shivering violently and backing away from the hospital-smell.

<p>
Pandemonium erupts in the classrom with the jangling ring of the bell.
Chattering loudly with each other, the students stand and prepare to head to the
cafeteria.  Folding her arms atop her desk and laying her head upon them, Nadia
sits among the chaos like a stone in the twisting eddies of a brook.  Eyes
half-closed, she watches Katarina chat with her friends, laughing, her beautiful
face glowing with joy, now reaching up with slender fingers to tuck a lock of
shining hair behind her flawless, perfectly-shaped ear.  Lost in a dreamlike
state, Nadia is startled when she sees Nikita standing outside the doorway,
peering at her with a bemused expression as she pushes her way into the room
past those leaving.
</p>
<p>
"Hey, Nadia," she says simply.  "Come on, let's get some food."  Before Nadia is
able to say anything, Nikita grabs her arm and drags her into the hall.  Weaving
deftly among the clusters of people, the girl pulls her through the long
corridors and into the cafeteria.  Rays of shimmering midafternoon sunlight
shine through the high windows, making Nikita's coppery hair flares into a
wreath of flame.  "You were looking at someone, just now.  Who was it?" she asks
after a moment.  Nadia's ears turn scarlet and her step falters.  The redhead
laughs softly as she steals a glance at the quiet girl, who mumbles uncertainly
and grips her left wrist tightly, rubbing the scar and biting her lip at the
pain.
</p>

<p class="int">
Dizzying waves of heat undulate oppressively from the fierce morning sun glaring
down from the clear blue sky.  A narrow dirt road shaded by a line of trees runs
past a decaying barn along the edge of a meadow overgrown by tall grass.  In the
middle of the field, a low hillock erupts from the surrounding landscape, and on
top of the mound, a wizened old tree looms over the scenery.  Multitudes of tiny
flowers blossom among the dark green foliage of the tree, shimmering as the wind
gently brushes against them.  Nadia stands in the field gazing into the branches
which twist in labyrinthine patterns.  Mumbling incoherently, vision frantically
tracing random paths on the wood, her eyes widen and she steps backwards.  Blood
cascades in a dark rivulet from a gash in her left wrist, staining her dress red
and pooling at her feet.  Numbly, her right arm drops to her side, and the knife
held loosely in her hand slowly spins to the ground.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Tears well up in Nadia's eyes as she flinches away from the harsh pain prickling
in a red hand-print on the side of her face.  Exuding a terrifying aura of
power, a vague, shadowy figure stands over her, scowling.  Nadia whimpers
pitifully and clutches a knife tightly in her right hand, tensing in
anticipation of the next, ruthless blow, which sends the blade flying from her
grasp.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Eyes wide with horror and wonder, Nadia stares in disbelief at the bloodless cut
in her arm.  As the other children point at her and jeer, spitting insults which
cause greater pain than any physical injury, Nadia frowns and slowly plunges the
knife into her arm, ripping open her flesh.  In a flash of light, her tormentors
vanish, and Nadia lies crumpled on the grassy ground in a pool of her own blood.
A dull thudding noise fills her head and she writhes to escape the sound, and an
object flies overhead.  Nadia's eyes dart about randomly, trying to focus on the
shadow blocking the light, but vivid blossoms of intense colour explode around a
shimmering haze behind her eyelids, swallowed by inky darkness.  She coughs up a
mass of blood, convulses violently, then sinks into an oblivious void.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Wincing, slowly opening her right eye, the girl rolls on her side and pushes her
small frame to a reclining position, leaning on her right arm.  Her ragged gasps
for air echo harshly in the dim, cement room.  As she shifts her weight to stand
up, her hand slides across the slick covering of the bed and plunges towards the
floor, scraping against a metal protrusion, leaving a stinging line of torn skin
beaded with swelling drops of blood along her forearm.  Tears flow down her face
as her body convulses with agitation, sending her tumbling to the ground with an
anguished yelp and a loud thud.  Curled into a ball on the cool cement, her sobs
gradually subside and she closes her right eye.
</p>
<p class="int">
Coughing, the girl awakens and blinks blearily.  She stands up stiffly and holds
her stinging right arm away from her body.  Uncertainly looking around the room,
her eyes focus and refocus in the half-light, trying to find any reference point
to orient herself.  Finally she sees a glint of light on the wall and approaches
cautiously.  Standing before the silvery rectangle, she stares dully at the girl
captured therein.  Fine grey hair hangs in limp disarray to her shoulders and in
a tangled mess before her face.  Absently, the girl in the room brushes the hair
away from her eyes with her metallic left hand.  Breathing heavily, she freezes,
staring with wide-eyed terror at the steely apparatus of her left arm which fits
into the intricate workings of the mechanism of her shoulder.  A low feral whine
bubbles from the back of her throat as she tries to twist away from the cold
devices grafted onto her body.  Straining her muscles, she flails about, looking
down at her chest and gagging.  Panting, she gingerly touches the raw seam which
runs down the middle of her naked torso and blanches.  She clenches her teeth in
agony, closes her eyes, and wildly claws and scrapes at the fissure, digging her
fingers under the implant and pulling at it.  Her stomach twists inside her as a
mass of blood erupts from her mouth, and she falls to the floor, doubled over in
pain.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Time passes in a hazy blur, dulled by a monotonous humming which drives into the
brain.  Movement is all but impossible as thick cables burrow into the skin, and
writhe through the muscles.  The murky atmosphere is thick, and difficult to see
through.  Amorphous figures mill about beyond the dimness which is punctuated by
brilliant flashes of blue-white light.  Something cold pricks at the back of the
neck, then overcoming resistance and sliding into the spine below the skull.  It
jets a fluid into the nervous system, sending an icy nausea sweeping through the
bloodstream, followed by numbness and oblivion.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
The body, naked, is frozen in time, embalmed in a frigid solution that sears all
the flesh with pinpricks of fire.  The mind, adrift, is free to wander randomly,
and incoherent visions and thoughts unspeakable float behind eyes closed against
the painful sensation of countless tendrils which dig into the base of the neck.
Multitudes of fibres snake along the limbs, twisting just beneath the surface of
the skin.  Frustration and helplessness explode through the head as any attempts
at movement make the limbs spasm and thrash about uncontrollably.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Cool breeze.  Dew.  Morning.  Ivy clings to the rough stone walls of the cottage
nestled among tall pine trees.  The swing on the shaded front porch creaks as it
sways back and forth.  Bright sunlight is filtered into dim coruscating speckles
of gold on the uneven lawn.  Songs of birds, the gently rustling leaves...a warm
glow, a feeling of belonging...of Home.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
The late winter sun slips slowly to the distant horizon, flickering like a dying
fire between the bare branches of the lonely line of trees growing along the far
side of the vast snow-covered field.  A flock of geese flies low overhead, wings
beating slowly against the lavender twilight.  Distantly, the mournful wail of a
train whistle echoes in the frigid air.  Ice crunches underfoot as a young girl,
bundled in a heavy fur-lined coat and a pale grey ushanka, gets up from her seat
on a cold iron bench on the railway platform and stamps her feet, breathing into
her hands to warm them.  Darkness settles, and heavy flakes of snow drop through
the brisk sky, clinging to the girl's pale eyelashes and draping her with a soft
blanket of frost.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p class="int">
Light snow falls, feathery white crystals clinging to mottled marble of a statue
of an angel, frost brushing her bare arm raised overhead, gently sweeping around
the curve of her exposed breast and filling the folds of a cloak that flows in a
wave from a clasp at the shoulder down her side and seems to cling wetly to long
legs.  Shimmering clumps of ice adorn ornately carved feathers on wings that are
spread in flight, and sheathe in rainbows a sword held in the sculpture's hand.
</p>
<p class="int">
Small drifts of powdery snow swirl around the faceless mid-afternoon pedestrians
who rush to the warmth of the coffee shops and curio dealers which face the open
plaza.  Nadia sits quietly on a bench near the fountain surmounted by the seraph
and stares numbly at pigeons which flutter and peck about at her feet.
</p>
<p class="int">
With a stinging thud, a dirty ball of packed snow and pebbles smacks the side of
Nadia's face and falls, leaving behind freezing particles and raw scratches.  An
unruly group of delinquents points and laughs jeeringly, holding more snowballs.
Coughing, Nadia lifts a hand to her face, wincing and looking at her hand, right
eye opening wide.  As she turns her head to search for her assailants, they yell
and scatter at the sight of golden sunlight glinting from the metal shell of the
left side of her face.  Pressing her hand against her cheek, Nadia turns back to
resume staring blankly at the ground in front of the bench.
</p>
<p class="int">
Hours pass, and the lights hanging among the branches of the trees begin to glow
like jewels as the short winter day wanes and the silver moon rises over the far
horizon.  The crowd thins, and the number of couples daring to brave the weather
on intimate strolls dwindles as well.  Low, melodic tones ring as the clock over
the plaza chimes six times, the last of the shopkeepers closing their businesses
for the evening.  Night descends, and the lone girl sits, unmoving, on the bench
as snow silently drapes a white cloak over the city.
</p>
<p class="int">
Shortly, the snow stops falling and the clouds disperse.  Myriad stars wheel and
twinkle overhead as a frigid wind blows, sending snow hissing along the fountain
and whipping Nadia's short hair about her face.  Rosy fingers of dawn caress the
eastern sky, and spread molten gold in shimmering waves from the horizon.  Nadia
lowers her head, eye glistening and a look of sorrow contorting her features.  A
sudden expression of terror flickers across her face, and she slumps forward
onto the ground, twitching as a pool of blood spreads beneath her.  Rays of
sunlight, thrown from the rising sun, sparkle on a line of ice on her cheek;
tears, frozen as they fell.

Driving in from the wild sea, the thin fingers of salt-laced wind thread amongst
the tall heather and twist in eddies along the spidery clumps of moss which grow
from cracks in the uneven road haphazardly roaming the broken terrain.  Her feet
bleeding, cut by the jagged stones on the ground, Nadia stumbles among weathered
hulks of cars with shattered windows and skeletons sitting inside.  Shuddering a
bit as she passes each one, she clutches a battered stuffed animal tightly under
her thin left arm.  Occasionally, she falls to her knees and vomits, coughing up
bile and blood.  Eyes watering in pain, she stands shakily and continues to walk
forward.  The copper sun slides beneath the distant crashing waves, and, along a
distant stretch of highway, lights begin to shine like amber gems.

<p><!-- 1999-Jan-04 --><b>2451183: Doorway</b></p>
<p>
Pallid light spills into the drab room through the iron bars which bind the only
window in the room.  Cracks meander randomly down the plaster walls, small piles
of dust gathering at the places where they plunge into the linoleum floor.  Very
little furniture occupies the room; the head of an iron-frame bed is against the
middle of a side wall under a broad fluorescent light fixture, and a small table
is next to the door in the wall across from the window.  A girl, dressed in a
pale blue hospital gown, lays on her back on the bed, gazing dully at the tiled
ceiling.  Much of her left side is bandaged, the layers of gauze stained by dark
red patches of blood.   Moving her lips silently as she stares upwards, the girl
talks to herself, inner dialogue played unconsciously on her vacant expression.
Dimming slowly, the light fades into darkness, brightening some time later, then
repeating in a numbing monotony.  The girl is still, slipping into a restless
slumber.  A diffuse twilight illuminates the room when the girl wakes, and she
lurches upright, swinging her legs over the side of the bed.  For an
indeterminate length of time she sits like this, eyes focussed on nothing.
</p>
<p>
Abruptly, she stands up and ambles to the door, cautiously turning the knob.
Slowly, the door swings open, and the girl steps into the quiet corridor.
Breathing heavily, she stumbles, leaning on the doorframe and knocking a
clipboard to the floor.  Illegible scrawling crowds the first page, but typing
at the top spells out the word '&#1053;&#1072;&#1076;&#1103;'.
</p>
<p>
"Nadia," the girl whispers, furrowing her brow in confusion.  Her name?  She
shuffles down the dark hallway, emerging in a bright room with glass walls and
doors.  Eyes widening in recognition of an exit, Nadia furtively looks about to
make certain she isn't seen.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a severe
woman behind a desk.  Nadia swallows, smiling weakly and raising her hand in an
attempt to wave.  Noticing the sheath of bandages on her upraised arm, she gawks
at the appendage, then quickly drops it to her side, her face darkening.  Moving
slowly, Nadia begins to approach the doors, and the woman at the desk frowns and
reaches for something under it with her right hand.  Nadia starts to run, but is
startled by a shout behind her.  In a dulled haze, she trips, falling slowly and
eternally in a lazy spiral, the voices of the orderlies muffled as they drag her
back to her room.  Roughly, they grasp her wrists and ankles, tightly binding in
painful restraints, then force open her mouth and insert a hard leather plate to
prevent her from biting her tongue.  Stripping off her gown, they inject a drug
into her forearm, and her body instantly relaxes.  The orderlies file out of the
room and lock the door behind them, leaving Nadia's naked body tied to the bed.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 1999-Jan-08 --><b>2451187: Enter the Outside</b></p>
<p>
Nadia quietly closes the heavy door behind her and sits in the metal folding
chair in the centre of the bare room, facing a row of desks behind which sit
tired-looking adults.  Clasping her hands in her lap, desperately willing
herself to be still, to not fidget, she keeps her eyes fixed in front of her,
avoiding looking at anything, <i>especially</i> the broad plastic tag secured to
her left wrist.  Several minutes pass as the panel of interviewers finishes
working on their paperwork, finally one clearing his throat and straightening
the sheaf in his hands with a tap on the desk.
</p>
<p>
"Nadia...Quidam, is it?"  The man leafs through the papers and peers at one,
then looks questioningly at the grey-haired woman sitting beside him, who nods
and speaks in a clear voice.
</p>
<p>
"Nadia was recovered from an automotive accident, with no other survivors.  She
herself is unable to recall any relevant information, and the only
identification we were able to recover was the name engraved on her necklace.
Local census data indicates she has no family in the immediate area..the name
'&#1053;&#1077;&#1082;&#1090;&#1086;' is rare - from 'quidam', a Latin word
meaning, simply, 'someone'...more specifically, a nameless average person,
indistinguishable from the masses.  We'll keep looking for relatives."
</p>
<p>
"I...see," noted the man, stifling a yawn and eyeing Nadia over his glasses.
"So be it.  Nadia Quidam.  Date of birth unknown, age approximately..."  He
takes a pen and writes on the paper.  "...eighteen.  Nationality Russian, having
no known family, finances, et cetera.  Level of schooling, unknown, though
likely at least some high school, based on these aptitude tests.  This
organization shall award you, to take place of insurance at current rates, and
in consideration of your circumstances, a sum of two million, six hundred
thirty-three thousand, seven hundred rubles.  We will assist you in finding a

<p>
Ghostly wings of moths dart and circle in the flickering halo of the streetlight
under which Nadia pauses and takes out a piece of paper.  A wispy cloud escapes
her parted lips as she exhales in the cool evening air.  Furrowing her brow and
turning the paper left and right a few times, she finally lifts her head, taking
a few moments to look around, then turns and enters a yard between two
warehouses, dead and dying weeds poking up through the frost gathering on the
bare dirt.  A large cat lounges on a rusted-out car hidden in the shadows,
staring at Nadia through half-lidded eyes and yawning.  Nadia picks her way
across the litter cluttering the area and enters a burnt-out shell of an
apartment building.
</p>
<p>
Feeling her way up unlit stairs, Nadia stumbles several times before arriving at
the second floor.  In the passage's wan light, she fumbles for a key and unlocks
a rusty door that swings open with a groaning creak.  Walking into the room,
Nadia looks for a light before letting the door close with a dull thud behind
her, plunging the room into inky blackness.  Moments later, a watery green light
blinks unsteadily, then flares into a steady white glow accompanied by a loud
buzz.  Nadia drops the chain of the switch and places the bag in a relatively
clean corner of the room.  Weary, she lowers herself onto the bed, raising a
cloud of dust that makes her cough.  Eyes watering, she bends to untie her shoes
and carefully puts them near the head of the bed.  Dully, she stares at the
opposite wall, face void of expression.  As though remembering something
long-forgotten, the girl turns and reaches for the light switch and tugs at it,
silence enveloping the room as quickly as darkness.
</p>
<hr class="half">
<p><!-- 2005-Dec-01 --><b>2453706: Black Squirrel</b></p>
<p>
Frozen boughs laden with clumps of snow brush Nadia's head as she slowly passes
by an embankment bounding the yard of a small house.  Shuffling her feet, she
listlessly passes her grocery-filled bag from hand to hand, then swings it
behind her, gripping the handle with both hands.  Suddenly realizing she is
immitating the way Katarina had often carried her bag at school, Nadia blushes,
her cheeks turning scarlet.  She walks down the narrow street that descends a
gentle slope to the embankment along the slow river.  A rustle in the bush by
her head makes the dark-haired girl stop and study the dim recesses between the
earth and branches.  Carrying an acorn, a squirrel with black fur and piercing
red eyes scampers to the edge of the concrete wall, then sits up, staring at
her.  For a few minutes, Nadia gazes back at the rodent, a sense of unease
growing in her.  Unable to bear it any longer, she turns and resumes her
journey, breaking into a run.

<p>
Again, today, the man from the adjacent block came to knock on the door.
Again, today, asking for money.  Ever that which is meaningless to her, yet
so neccessary for her very existence.  And so she gives.  His words of assurance
that she will be repaid, that he is a different sort than others who have asked
of her...she nods vaguely to acknowledge them, yet knows they are untrue.  Her
funds will wane.  Eventually, to the point where she has nothing, and must make
good her unspoken promise with Creation, that her existence must certainly end
if she is unable to prove herself in the world by the time her inherentence
bleeds dry.
</p>
<p>
As surely she will be unable to do.
</p>
<p>
The endless giving of herself to others means nothing to the world.
Dependability cannot be purchased, only rented for a short time.  Too short a
time; and even then, it is a phantom, too easily dissolved when the hand is
outstretched to receive aid in kind.  Surely the pain of the world is deserved.
How else could it be?  Such agony, that the entire globe groans in despair...
Never light.
</p>
<p>
Only darkness, apart from the single, shining beacon of perfection that was
her memory of Katarina, and the elegant grace of dancers who give of themselves
to share beauty with others.  Purity, holiness, to the point of divinity.  A
stark contrast to her own sullied soul.  The darkness over her that would lower
humanity to the baseness of animals, to imagine that the closest of intimacy
were something feral beasts even capable of sharing with humans.  <i>Such irony,
she muses.  Verily, it is humans that are lower than the wild spirits of
nature.</i>
</p>
<p>
Her solitude, constant betrayal, the ghosts of memories that she cannot
be certain are real.  If there exists a higher power&ndash;call it what you will&ndash;
if tradition is true in declaring it just, then what can she be but a miserable
sinner?  If she does good deeds, will it bring her some small consolation?  How
much of her finances must she deplete to quell her unease?  All of it?  Must she
surely, somehow, remove her troublesome self from this world, in the end?

wraps her arms around herself and closes her eyes halfway, backing away from the
boisterous youths.  She shivers and takes a breath, then turns to walk by
herself.

<p>
"Shto, Nadia, don't want to hang out?  We don't bite..." shouted one, voice
thick from vodka, accompanied by snickers and a few "...very hard" commentaries.

The group slows at the drunken shout.  A thin man with pinched features and a
sneer swaggers over and drapes his arm across the shoulders of the vagrant boy's
girlfriend.

"Unless you want the police here, I suggest you back off.  NOW." the man growls
forcefully, staring with particular intent at the boys. Cowed by the aggressive
attitude of the man, Nadia lowers her gaze and grips her left wrist behind her
back, tensing her body in anticipation of the assault sure to follow.

"Hey." says Peitr softly, nudging her shoulder.  "Let's get out of here."  Heart
pounding and her breathing unsteady, Nadia looks up in surprise at the
retreating man and his daughter, then inhales sharply and turns to follow the
two boys.
