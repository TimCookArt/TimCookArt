<center><h1><p>Being Facts and Suppositions Commonly Known to the Inhabitants of the Provinces of the Legia Jerva, or</p></h1>
<h2><p>a Primer on Imperial Subject Understanding</p></h2>
<h3><p>as Set in Printed Form Anno Mutandus Stellarum 1742 by the Esq. Falric Vesad</p></h3></center>

<p>The Great City now named Jervn, Heart of the Empire, was bestowed thus after the reknowned leader of unifying armies, Jerva, 681 years before the current reckoning of dates was contrived.  The Legia Jerva stood unmatched in power and scope for 1154 years, until AMS 473, when crippling drought triggered the decision to turn its attention wholly to domestic matters and reduce its military, leading to the steady decline of this nation to its present situation.</p>

<p><b>Regarding its boundaries and notable features, which are portrayed in <a href="http://anybook.anysize.org/~kasuga_kyousuke/LegiaJervaMap.png">this map</a>.</b>  The Esach Mountains lie at the western border of the realm.  From the southwest, the River Nei flows beside the fertile Cosmurry valley to the south into the Bramir Lake, whose exit to the Diwethaf Ocean is guarded by Jervn to the northwest and the port Arur to the southeast.  Between the Cosmurry valley and Ebis River flowing from the Starlight Heights to the southeast rises the Temis Moor, its woods thick with wolves that prey on the scattered family-groups of foolish Gefi that have been encountered there by hunters.  The Ymir River flows through the Great Forest to the north of Bramir Lake, between the Esach Mountains and Mistfelt Peak, on whose slopes nature boils untamed, where vicious bears, malevolent tree-spirits, and shadowy Wood Elves stalk any unfortunate soul careless enough to wander its depths.  Uiwr, a Benevolent Protectorate of the Legia Jerva, is the last home of the almost-forgotten and all-but-vanished ancient race of Silver Elves at the northeasternmost edge of the empire, past miles of monster-infested sea.</p>

<p><b>Regarding those varieties of Thinking Beings which inhabit it, or of which have been reported to exist in other lands.</b>  <i>Humans</i>, blessed by merit of natural superiority, being most populous and adaptable of all the thinking races, can be found readily anywhere in the empire where civilisation flourishes.  <i>Silver Elves</i>--each wise, each ancient, each yet alive only by their skill in magics, of which they have forgotten nearly all which was once known--few remain.  Of the <i>Wood Elf</i> tribes, there are distinct and separate divisions; all are cunning and deceitful, jeering from their crude tree nests at the Empire which gives them wholly-undeserved sanctuary and protection of its laws even as they mock and manipulate treaties forced upon us by their bretheren, eroding the southern reaches of the Imperium.  There are, in truth, malevolent spirits which possess trees, deep in the darkness of forests--this, alone, is known of <i>Dryads</i>, but let it serve well as a guide to evade them.  <i>Gefi</i> are simple-minded deer-kin usually found in shallow forested areas, or, when a lonely hunter or soft-hearted farmer, finding one set apart takes pity on its life and brings it into their home or into a city, where it may gain employ as a low servant.  <i>Dwarves</i>, legends sometimes mentioned in old books, seem to be associated with some of the rubble-piles found in the mountains where two rivers come together, and these are topics one does well to never mention in earshot of, if you chance to encounter one, a <i>Silver Elf</i>.  Your humble guide will note here, also, the gnarled, hateful, rust-skinned misers that dodder around large towns.  Indeed, given the absurd, cruel and nearly-blasphemous notions implied in the available literature on the subject, perhaps it's best to never mention <i>Dwarves</i> in earshot of any, a word to the wise.  Far to the south, past the Dead Mountains, a sea of burning sand is described in implausible yarns spun by adventurers or merchants.  What's more, they say, are cat-people called <i>Jimjn</i>.  And if it's tall tales you're after, closer to home to seek are the wharfs crawling with sailors, who lie to your face and speak of <i>Mermaids</i> while pocketing your coin lost to a bowl of dice.</p>

<p><b>Regarding the Seven Immortals, and the schools of magic and endeavours they foster.</b>  Recognised by most, there are seven notably significant aetherial beings working their hand to what strikes their whim on this world, and to this end they are known in story to inhabit one or another mortal for a part of time to perform what tasks they may, or slumbering, then departing at their leisure for a new abode.  Of others, it is sure that exist, but all group variously under the auspice of one or another of the Seven.  While (as far as can be fathomed by the common mind) the level of supreme ability as associated with any one of the Seven is tantamount to equate to the notion of divinity, worship as an institution per se of any of these is uncommon in the Empire.  The Immortals are powerful, but they are rarely ascribed Divine status in the tales in which they appear.  Instead, the temples in cities are places of obscure uncertainty, beholden only to a vague notion of Universality that encompasses all, and if an individual favours one or another attribute as relevant to their life, so unto they pay heed.  And though, it is supposed, there are inevitable isolated cults or spiritualists who harbour their own philosophies and notions, here we shall, for sake of brevity, only detail the major Seven Immortals.  While particulars are unknown, is is accepted as that the Seven are not equal in age.  The implications of this are left for other, more scholarly tomes.</p>

<p>Each is associated with a colour, a realm of magical expertise, an energy, virtue, vice, and so on:</p>
<p><b>Yabbi</b>, the primary feminine aspect of nature, is associated with the elemental forces of Creation and life.  Her colour is the green of plants, and farmers often invoke her blessings.  Ever kind in her pursuit of fostering growth and fecundity, overindulgence in these activities encourages gluttony.  Spontaneity, ignorance, and innocence are her traits.</p>
<p><b>Dasach</b> is the hermaphrodite spirit associated with Jurisdiction and power.  Its colour is fire-red, and soldiers and the military are guided by its traits of control and authority.  Focus on self-control lends to temperance, but the individual must overcome the envy of others' freedom.  Transmutation is cast from the domain of Jurisdiction, as it is a spell that directs a substance to a specific goal (rather than simply changing it to anything-else).</p>
<p><b>Erla</b>, the feminine spirit of the sea, is associated with Alteration and chaos.  Her colour is ocean-blue, and she is seen as patron of of artists and performers, who change the perception of others.  Her interest is change for its own sake, deception, and communication as the fundamental force to evoke these between individuals.  Ever desiring only for things to be different, she encourages charity, which takes from one and gives to another, and lust, indulgence in physical sensation.  Spells of illusion, which change a thing's appearance, are part of the realm of Alteration.</p>
<p><b>Suru</b> is the androgyne spirit associated with Conservation and stasis.  Its colour is the unchanging blankness of white, and bureaucrats, forever tangled in their legalism, are favoured.  This desire for balance and avoidance of change leads to chastity and a conceptual approach to the idea of love that eschews the risk of creation, and encourages sloth.  Spells which heal and mend, returning something to its original state, are subject to the realm of Conservation.</p>
<p><b>Gwythr</b>, the androgyne spirit, is associated with Perception and kenning.  Its colour is gold, and all those involved in research and discovery of things are familiar with its influence and urge of curiosity.  To seek knowledge above all else necessitates patience, but greed and the desire to hoard away from others that which is acquired accompany these endeavours.  Scrying and spells of detection are governed by the realm of Perception.</p>
<p><b>Pyr Felas</b> is the masculine spirit associated with Exertion and ritual.  Pyr is the youngest of the Seven Immortals, once a mortal human, tasked with the unending mission of assisting others in time of great need.  His colour is grey, and he is seen as patron of all who toil and labour and expend much effort for little reward.  Dilligence is his, but when awareness of one's work is attained, overweening pride is a danger.  Spells which aid endeavours, increasing endurance or promoting industry, are part of the realm of Exertion.</p>
<p><b>Tl'kec</b>, the multitude, are associated with Destruction and death.  Their colour is black, and they guide both those who deal in morbidity, as by culling or funerary needs, as well as all manner of sadistic malevolence.  Familiarity with the inevitable conclusion of existence inculcates a profound sense of humility, but also instills wrath, a nihilistic hatred of everything.  In death, all things are equal, and any spell which furthers this cause belongs to the realm of Destruction, including battlemages' weapons.  (The name <b>Tl'kec</b> and its association stretches back further than surviving history, but its cults are recent, only appearing within the past few hundred years...)</p>

<p><b>Regarding necromancers and the Mindless Undead, known as plods.</b>  These products of necromancy are an abhorrent melding of aspects of four conflicting realms of magic.  From Destruction, knowledge of death itself.  From Creation and Conservation, the energies to force the body awaken to its previously animate state, but at the cost of a terrible hunger for living flesh.  From Exertion, the impetus allowing their useful application in menial servitude, such as drawing carts.  They can be found in large cities, or on the occasion that a necromancer sees need to journey elsewhere.  Their arms are firmly bound behind their backs, and their mouths encased in muzzles which can never be removed, lest the creature attack any living being.</p>

<h1>Misc. notes</h1>
<ul><li>Magic is an extremely difficult thing to learn, but if one applies themself, anybody can in theory learn how to use it.</li>
<li>Technology level is ca. 1750; steam engines exist, but are weak and inefficient.  Mechano-magical automata exist, but are extremely limited in functinonality and range.</li>
<li>No classes, character just does what they've learned how to do.</li>
<li>Economically, there are the rich nobles, and the relatively destitute masses, and a reasonably-sized middle-class of merchants.</li>
<li>A group has been called to the Jafeson Manor by the head butler, each specifically, to restore the deed and other items of importance to the widow to establish her claim on her property, to drive off the greedy nobles sucking the estate dry.</li>
